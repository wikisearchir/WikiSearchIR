{{infobox Scotland council area}}Aberdeenshire ({{lang-gd}}, {{lang-sco}}) is one of the 32 unitary council areas in Scotland and a lieutenancy area. The present day Aberdeenshire council area does not include the City of Aberdeen, now a separate council area, from which its name derives. Together, the modern council area and the city formed historic Aberdeenshire - one of the counties of Scotland formerly used for local government purposes. Within these borders, the County of Aberdeen remains in existence as a registration county.http://www.ros.gov.uk/pdfs/map.pdfAberdeenshire Council is headquartered at Woodhill House, in Aberdeen; the only Scottish council whose headquarters are based outwith its area's border. Aberdeenshire borders Angus and Perth and Kinross to the south, and Highland and Moray to the west.
HistoryAberdeenshire has a rich prehistoric and historic heritage.  It is the locus of a large number of Neolithic and Bronze Age archaeological sites, including Longman Hill, Kempstone Hill, Catto Long Barrow and Cairn Lee.  Since medieval times there have been a number of crossings of the Mounth (a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the North Sea slightly north of Stonehaven) through present day Aberdeenshire from the Scottish Lowlands to the Highlands.  Some of the most well known and historically important trackways are the Causey Mounth and Elsick Mounth.W. Douglas Simpson, "The Early Castles of Mar", Proceedings of the Society, 102, 10 December 1928{{cite web}}The present council area is named after the historic county of Aberdeen, which had different boundaries and was abolished in 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973.  It was replaced by Grampian Regional Council and five district councils: Banff and Buchan, Gordon, Kincardine and Deeside, Moray and the City of Aberdeen.  Local government functions were shared between the two levels.  In 1996, under the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994, the Banff and Buchan district, Gordon district and Kincardine and Deeside district were merged to form the present Aberdeenshire council area, with the other two districts becoming autonomous council areas.
DemographicsThe council area has a population of 236,260,{{cite web}} representing 4.6% of Scotland's total, a rise of over 50% from 1971. The population currently has a relatively high proportion of under 20s and fewer over-65s compared with the Scottish average, reflecting employment-driven in-migration in recent decades. The twelve biggest settlements in Aberdeenshire (with 2011 population estimates) are:

{{Infobox Organization}}The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is a learned society for computing. It was founded in 1947 as the world's first scientific and educational computing society.  Its membership is more than 92,000 as of 2009.  Its headquarters are in New York City.
Activities
ACM is organized into over 170 local chapters and 35 Special Interest Groups (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities.  Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.Many of the SIGs, like SIGGRAPH, SIGPLAN, SIGCSE and SIGCOMM, sponsor regular conferences which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields.  The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between Garry Kasparov and the IBM Deep Blue computer.
ServicesACM Press publishes a prestigious academic journal,
Journal of the ACM, and general magazines for computer professionals, Communications of the ACM (also known as Communications or CACM) and Queue.  Other publications of the ACM include:

ACM XRDS, formally &#34;Crossroads&#34; and renamed and designed in 2010, the most popular student computing magazine in the US.
ACM interactions, an interdisciplinary HCI publication focused on the connections between experiences, people and technology, and the third largest ACM publication. http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1897239.1897240http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/1900000/1897240/p5-wakkary.html?ip=67.34.143.195&CFID=44596637&CFTOKEN=44967240&__acm__=1316999391_2787abbb2aacb2555d1377d1e08471e5
A number of journals, specific to subfields of computer science, titled ACM Transactions.  Some of the more prominent transactions include:
ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS)
ACM Transactions on Database Systems (TODS)
ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG)
ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS)
ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS)


Although Communications no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid subscribers online at its Digital Library and also has a Guide to Computing Literature. Individual members additionally have access to Safari Books Online and Books24x7. The ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.
Digital LibraryThe ACM Digital Library, a part of the ACM Portal, contains a comprehensive archive of the organization's journals, magazines, and conference proceedings.  Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest.ACM requires the copyright of all submissions to be assigned to the organization as a condition of publishing the work.ACM Copyright Policy  Authors may post the documents on their own websites, but they are required to link back to the digital library's reference page for the paper.  Though authors are not allowed to charge for access to copies of their work, downloading a copy from the ACM site requires a paid subscription.
CompetitionACM's primary historical competitor has been the IEEE Computer Society, which is the largest subgroup of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.  The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical computer science, but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda.  They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.{{cite web}}  Some of the major awards in Computer science are given jointly by ACM and the IEEE-CS.See, e.g., Ken Kennedy AwardThere is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the open access movement.  Some authors see a centralized peer-review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like arXiv.  Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR) and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.
Membership gradesIn addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and "demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers".ACM Senior Members-An Overview
Fellows{{See also}}
The ACM Fellows Program was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 "to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM."There are presently about 500 FellowsList of ACM Fellows out of about 60,000 professional members.
Other membership gradesIn 2006 ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades. Senior Members have ten or more years of membership and demonstrated performance.  Distinguished Engineers and Distinguished Scientists have at least 15 years of membership who "have made a significant impact on the computing field".

Conferences{{Ref improve section}}
The ACM sponsors numerous conferences listed below.  Most of the special interest groups also have an annual conference.  ACM conferences are often very popular publishing venues and are therefore very competitive.  For example, the 2007 SIGGRAPH conference attracted about 30000 visitors, and CIKM only accepted 15% of the long papers that were submitted in 2005.

LeadershipThe President of the ACM for 2010&ndash;2012ACM Elects New Leaders Committed to Expanding International Initiatives is Alain Chesnais, a French citizen living in Toronto where he runs his company named Visual Transitions. He is the successor of Wendy Hall of the University of Southampton.ACM is led by a Council consisting of the President, Vice-President, Treasurer, Past President, SIG Governing Board Chair, Publications Board Chair, three representatives of the SIG Governing Board, and seven Members-At-Large.  This institution is often referred to simply as "Council" in Communications of the ACM.
InfrastructureACM has five “Boards” that make up various committees and subgroups, to help Headquarters staff maintain quality services and products. These boards are as follows:

Publications Board
SIG Governing Board
Education Board
Membership Services Board
Professions Board


ACM-W: Association for Computing Machinery Committee on WomenACM-W, the ACM's committee on women in computing, is set up to support, inform, celebrate, and work with women in computing. Dr. Anita Borg was a great supporter of ACM-W. ACM-W provides various resources for women in computing as well as high school girls interested in the field. ACM-W also reaches out internationally to those women who are involved and interested in computing.

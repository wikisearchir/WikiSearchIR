Political viewsAs an MP Widdecombe has expressed conservative views, including opposition to abortion; it was understood during her time in frontline politics that she would not become Health Secretary as long as this involved responsibility for abortions. Although a committed Christian, she has characterised the issue as one of life and death on which her view had been the same when she was agnostic.{{cite news}} Along with John Gummer MP, she converted from the Church of England to the Roman Catholic Church following the decision of the Church of England on the Ordination of women as priests.{{cite news}} In her speech at the 2000 Conservative conference, she called for a zero tolerance policy of prosecution, albeit with only £100 fines as the punishment, for users of cannabis. This was well-received by rank-and-file Conservative delegates.{{cite news}}In 2003, together with fellow Roman Catholic MP Edward Leigh, Widdecombe proposed an amendment opposing repeal of Section 28 of the Local Government Act, which banned the promotion of homosexuality by local governments. Out of the 17 parliamentary votes considered by the Public Whip website to concern equal rights for homosexuals, Widdecombe took the opposing position in 15 cases, not being present at the other two votes."Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Homosexuality – Equal rights'", Public Whip. Retrieved on 24 June 2009.She is a committed animal lover and one of the few Conservative MPs to have consistently voted for the ban on fox hunting."Ann Widdecombe compared to 'Fox hunting – Ban'", Public Whip. Retrieved on 21 March 2009.She has expressed a variety of views on climate change but has been opposed to legislation reducing emissions. Her views on the subject appear to have hardened over time. In 2007, she wrote that she did not want to belittle the issue but was sceptical of the claims that specific actions would prevent catastrophe,{{cite web}} then in 2008 that her doubts had been “crystalised” by Nigel Lawson's book An Appeal to Reason,{{cite web}} before stating in 2009 that "There is no climate change, hasn’t anybody looked out of their window recently?"{{cite web}}Over the years, Widdecombe has expressed her support for a reintroduction of the death penalty, which was abolished in the UK in 1965. She notably spoke of her support for its reintroduction for the worst cases of murder in the aftermath of the murder of two 10-year-old girls from Soham, Cambridgeshire, in August 2002. She supported the argument that the death penalty would have deterrent value, as within five years of its abolition the national murder rate had more than doubled.{{cite news}}
In governmentWiddecombe joined John Major's government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security in 1990. In 1993, she was moved to the Department of Employment, and she was promoted to Minister of State the following year.

Shadow CabinetAfter the fall of the Conservative government to Labour in 1997, she served as Shadow Health Secretary between 1998 and 1999 and later as Shadow Home Secretary between 1999 and 2001 under William Hague.{{cite news}}
Leadership contest and backbenchesDuring the 2001 Conservative leadership election, she could not find sufficient support amongst Conservative MPs for her leadership candidacy. She first supported Michael Ancram, who was eliminated in the first round, and then Kenneth Clarke, who lost in the final round. She afterwards declined to serve in Iain Duncan Smith's Shadow Cabinet (although she indicated on the television programme When Louis Met..., prior to the leadership contest, that she wished to retire to the backbenches anyway).In the 2005 leadership election, she initially supported Kenneth Clarke again. Once he was eliminated, she turned support towards Liam Fox. Following Fox's subsequent elimination, she took time to reflect before finally declaring for David Davis. She expressed reservations over the eventual winner David Cameron, feeling that he did not, like the other candidates, have a proven track record, and she was later a leading figure in parliamentary opposition to his A-List policy, which she has said is "an insult to women".{{cite news}} At the October 2006 Conservative Conference, she was Chief Dragon in a political version of the television programme Dragons' Den, in which A-list candidates were invited to put forward a policy proposal, which was then torn apart by her team of Rachel Elnaugh, Oliver Letwin and Michael Brown.{{cite news}}In an interview with Metro in September 2006 she stated that if Parliament were of a normal length, it was likely she would retire at the next general election.{{cite news}} She confirmed her intention to stand down to The Observers Pendennis diary in September 2007,{{cite news}} and again in October 2007 after Prime Minister Gordon Brown quashed speculation of an autumn 2007 general election.{{cite news}}Widdecombe was one of the 98 MPs who voted to keep their expense details secret.{{cite news}} When the expenses claims were leaked, however, Widdecombe was described by The Daily Telegraph as one of the "saints" amongst all MPs.{{cite news}}In May 2009, following the resignation of Michael Martin as Speaker of the House of Commons, it was reported that Widdecombe was gathering support for election as interim Speaker until the next general election.{{cite news}} On 11 June 2009, she confirmed her bid to be the Speaker.{{cite news}} She made it through to the second ballot but came last and was eliminated.{{cite news}}Widdecombe retired from politics at the 2010 general election.
RecognitionWiddecombe was appointed an Honorary Fellow of Canterbury Christ Church University at a ceremony held at Canterbury Cathedral on 30 January 2009.{{cite web}}
Personal life and familyUntil her retirement at the 2010 general election, Widdecombe divided her time between her two homes – one in London and one in the village of Sutton Valence, Kent, in her constituency.{{cite web}} She sold both of these properties, however, upon deciding to retire at the next general election.{{cite news}}{{cite news}} She shared her home in London with her widowed mother, Rita Widdecombe, until Rita's death, on 1 May 2007, aged 95.Conservative MP's mother dies, aged 95. Retrieved from http://www.kentnews.co.uk/kent-news/Conservative-MP_s-mother-dies,-aged-95-newsinkent3663.aspx.

In November 2007 on BBC Radio 4 she described how a journalist once produced a profile on her with the assumption that she had had at least "one sexual relationship", to which Widdecombe replied: "Be careful, that's the way you get sued". When interviewer Jenni Murray asked if she had ever had a sexual relationship, Widdecombe laughed "it's nobody else's business".{{cite web}}
Religious viewsWiddecombe is a practising Roman Catholic, a denomination of Christianity to which she converted in 1993 after leaving the Church of England.{{cite news}} Her reasons for leaving the latter were many, as she explained to reporters from the New Statesman:

I left the Church of England because there was a huge bundle of straw. The ordination of women was the last straw, but it was only one of many. For years I had been disillusioned by the Church of England&#39;s compromising on everything. The Catholic Church doesn&#39;t care if something is unpopular.{{cite web}}

She recently turned down an offer to be Britain's next ambassador to the Holy See, being prevented from accepting by suffering a detached retina."He's just my first bit of fun", interview in The Times, by Margarette Driscoll, 26 September 2010.
ControversiesIn 1990, following the assassination of the Conservative politician Ian Gow by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Eastbourne by-election for his seat in the House of Commons was won by the Liberal Democrat David Bellotti. Upon the announcement, Widdecombe told the voters that the IRA would be "toasting their success".{{cite news}}In 1996, Widdecombe, as prisons minister, defended the Government's policy to shackle pregnant prisoners with handcuffs and chains when in hospital. Widdecombe told the Commons the restrictions were needed to prevent prisoners from escaping. "Some MPs may like to think that a pregnant woman would not or could not escape. Unfortunately this is not true. The fact is that hospitals are not secure places in which to keep prisoners, and since 1990, 20 women have escaped from hospitals"{{cite news}}{{cite news}}In 1997, during the Conservative leadership election of William Hague, Widdecombe spoke out against Michael Howard, under whom she had served when he was Home Secretary. She famously remarked "there is something of the night about him". The remark was considered to be extremely damaging to Howard, who was frequently satirised as a vampire thereafter.{{cite news}} He came last in the poll. Howard went on to become party leader in 2003, however, and Widdecombe then stated, "I explained fully what my objections were in 1997 and I do not retract anything I said then. But this is 2005 and we have to look to the future and not the past."{{cite news}}In 2001, when Michael Portillo was running for leader of the Conservative Party, Widdecombe described him and his allies as "backbiters". She went on to say that, should he be appointed leader, she would never give him her allegiance.

Following her second appearance, Widdecombe vowed she would never appear on the show again because of comments made by panellist Jimmy Carr. She wrote, "His idea of wit is a barrage of filth and the sort of humour most men grow out of in their teens.... [T]here's no amount of money for which I would go through those two recording hours again. At one stage I nearly walked out."Ann Widdecombe in the Daily Express, as quoted by {{cite news}} She did, however, stand by her appraisal of regular panellists Ian Hislop and Paul Merton, whom she has called "the fastest wits in showbusiness".She awarded the 2007 University Challenge trophy.{{cite web}} In the same year, she was cast as herself in "The Sound of Drums", the 12th episode of the third series of the science-fiction drama Doctor Who supporting Mr Saxon, the alias of the Master.{{cite web}}Since 2007, Widdecombe has fronted a television series called Ann Widdecombe Versus, on ITV1, in which she speaks to various people about things related to her as an MP, with an emphasis on confronting those responsible for problems she wished to tackle.

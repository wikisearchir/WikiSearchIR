Loveline{{Main}}
{{Original research}}
Carolla was offered the job of co-hosting Loveline with physician Dr. Drew Pinsky in 1995, alongside Riki Rachtman. While primarily a call-in show where listeners would ask questions about sex and relationships, Carolla would often spend much of the show ranting about various topics, from his time working as a contractor to incessant radio weather and traffic reports ("How many traffic reports have you listened to? Thousands. How many times have you actually changed your route based on a traffic report? That's right! Never!""Loveline August 18, 2003".). Carolla served as the louder, funnier side of the show in contrast to the reserved, thoughtful Dr. Drew. Carolla left the show in 2005.On May 13, 2009, Adam returned to Loveline as a guest. During a typical discourse with a caller who was giving short, unaccommodating responses, Carolla snapped jokingly "Oh, Jesus Christ, I don't miss this God-damn show one second!" Adam said being on Loveline was like "visiting your grandfather at the morgue".Kevin and Bean, May 15, 2009

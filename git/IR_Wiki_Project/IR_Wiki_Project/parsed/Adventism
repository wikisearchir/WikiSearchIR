{{Adventism}}{{Christianity}}Adventism is a Christian movement which began in the 19th century, in the context of the Second Great Awakening revival in the United States. The name refers to belief in the imminent Second Coming (or "Second Advent") of Jesus Christ. It was started by William Miller, whose followers became known as Millerites. Today, the largest church within the movement is the Seventh-day Adventist Church.The Adventist family of churches is regarded today as conservative Protestants."Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches" section (p. 256–276) in Frank S. Mead, Samuel S. Hill and Craig D. Atwood, Handbook of Denominations in the United States, 12th edn. Nashville: Abingdon Press Although these churches hold much in common, their theology differs on whether the intermediate state is unconscious sleep or consciousness, whether the ultimate punishment of the wicked is annihilation or eternal torment, the nature of immortality, whether or not the wicked are resurrected after the millennium, and whether the sanctuary of {{bibleverse}} refers to the one in heaven or one on earth. The movement has encouraged the examination of the New Testament, leading them to observe the Sabbath.
History{{See also}}
Adventism began as an inter-denominational movement. Its most vocal leader was William Miller. Between 50,000 and 100,000 people in the United States supported Miller's predictions of Christ's return. After the "Great Disappointment" of October 22, 1844 many people in the movement gave up on Adventism.  Of those remaining Adventist, the majority gave up believing in any prophetic (biblical) significance for the October 22 date, yet they remained expectant of the near Advent (second coming of Jesus). Of those who retained the October 22 date, many maintained that Jesus had come not literally but "spiritually", and consequently were known as "spiritualizers". A small minority held that something concrete had indeed happened on October 22, but this event had been misinterpreted. This viewpoint later emerged and crystallized with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the largest remaining body today.George Knight, A Brief History of Seventh-day Adventists
Albany ConferenceThe Albany Conference in 1845, attended by 61 delegates, was called to attempt to determine the future course and meaning of the Millerite movement. Following this meeting, the "Millerites" then became known as "Adventists" or "Second Adventists". However, the delegates disagreed on several theological points.  Four groups emerged from the conference: The Evangelical Adventists, The Life and Advent Union, the Advent Christian Church, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.The largest group organized as the American Millennial Association, a portion of which was later known as the Evangelical Adventist Church. Unique among the Adventists, they believed in an eternal hell and consciousness in death. They declined in numbers, and by 1916 their name did not appear in the United States Census of Religious Bodies. It has diminished to almost non-existence today. Their main publication was the Advent Herald,partial archives of which Sylvester Bliss was the editor until his death in 1863. It was later called the Messiah’s Herald. The Life and Advent Union was founded by George Storrs in the year of 1863. He had established The Bible Examiner in 1842. It merged with the Adventist Christian Church in 1964. The Advent Christian Church officially formed in 1861, and grew rapidly at first. It declined a little over the 20th century.  The Advent Christians publish the four magazines The Advent Christian Witness, Advent Christian News, Advent Christian Missions and Maranatha. They also operate a liberal arts college at Aurora, Illinois; and a Bible College at Lennox, Massachusetts.  The Primitive Advent Christian Church later separated from a few congregations in West Virginia.The Seventh-day Adventist Church officially formed in 1863.  It believes in the sanctity of the seventh-day Sabbath as a holy day for worship.  It published the Adventist Review and Sabbath Herald.  It has grown to a large worldwide denomination and has a significant network of medical and educational institutions.Miller did not join any of the movements, and spent the last few years of his life working for unity, before dying in 1849.
DenominationsThe Handbook of Denominations in the United States, 12th edn., describes the following churches as "Adventist and Sabbatarian (Hebraic) Churches":
Christadelphians{{Main}}

Hudson and George Storrs formed the "Advent Christian Association" in Salem, Massachusetts in 1860.
Primitive Advent Christian Church{{Main}}
The Primitive Advent Christian Church is a small group which separated from the Advent Christian Church. They differ from the parent body mainly in two points. They observe feet washing as a rite of the church, and they teach that reclaimed backsliders should be baptized (even though they had formerly been baptized). This is sometimes referred to as rebaptism.
Seventh-day Adventist{{Main}}
The Seventh-day Adventist Church, founded in 1863, and had 16,600,000 baptized members (not counting children of members) worldwide as of 2010Secretary: Now 16.6 million members, but challenging regions loom large is best known for its teaching that Saturday, the seventh day of the week, is the Sabbath and is the appropriate day for worship.

Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association{{Main}}
The Davidians (originally named Shepherd's Rod) is a small offshoot with an unknown number of members made up primarily of voluntarily disfellowshipped members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. They were originally known as the Shepherd's Rod and are still referred to as such.  The group derives its name from two books on Bible doctrine written by their founder, Victor Houteff, in 1929.
Branch DavidiansThe Branch Davidians were a split ("branch") from the Davidians. Many of them perished in the infamous Waco Siege of 1993.

Other relationshipsThe Bible Students movement founded by Charles Taze Russell had in its early development close connections with the Millerite movement and stalwarts of the Adventist faith, including George Storrs and Joseph Seiss. The various groupings of Bible Students currently have a cumulative membership of less than 20,000 worldwide. Although the Jehovah's Witnesses (who emerged in 1931 following a schism in the Bible Students movement that began in 1917) and remaining Bible Students are not generally regarded as part of the Millerite Adventist movement, Russell attended and eventually led an Adventist oriented Bible study church from 1870–74.  Avowing his indebtedness to Adventism, he "was deeply influenced by Adventist thought."Handbook, p268 As of December 2008 there were approximately 7 million Jehovah's Witnesses worldwide.

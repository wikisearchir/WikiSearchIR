{{Infobox River}}The Alabama River, in the U.S. state of Alabama, is formed by the Tallapoosa and Coosa rivers, which unite about {{convert}} north of Montgomery.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/11995/Alabama-River  The river flows west to Selma, then southwest until, about {{convert}} from Mobile, it unites with the Tombigbee, forming the Mobile and Tensaw rivers, which discharge into Mobile Bay. The course of the Alabama is very meandering.http://www.caria.org/navigation.html Its width varies from {{convert}}, and its depth from {{convert}}. Its length as measured by the United States Geological Survey is {{convert}},U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed April 27, 2011 and by steamboat measurement, {{convert}}.{{Citation needed}}  The river crosses the richest agricultural and timber districts of the state.  Railways connect it with the mineral regions of north-central Alabama.  After the Coosa and Tallapoosa rivers, the principal tributary of the Alabama is the Cahaba River, which is about {{convert}} long and joins the Alabama River about {{convert}} below Selma. The Alabama River's main tributary, the Coosa River, crosses the mineral region of Alabama and is navigable for light-draft boats from Rome, Georgia, to about {{convert}} above Wetumpka (about {{convert}} below Rome and {{convert}} below Greensport), and from Wetumpka to its junction with the Tallapoosa. The channel of the river has been considerably improved by the federal government.  The navigation of the Tallapoosa River –- which has its source in Paulding County, Georgia, and is about {{convert}} long -– is prevented by shoals and a {{convert}} fall at Tallassee, a few miles north of its junction with the Coosa. The Alabama is navigable throughout the year.The river played an important role in the growth of the economy in the region during the 19th century as a source of transportation of goods. The river is still used for transportation of farming produce; however, it is not as important as it once was due to the construction of roads and railways.The Alabama, Coosa, and Tallapoosa rivers were central to the homeland of the Creek Indians before their removal by United States forces to the Indian Territory in the 1830s.

{{Multiple issues}}{{Politics of Armenia}}
Since its independence, Armenia has maintained a policy of complementarism by trying to have friendly relations both with Iran, Russia, and the West, including the United States and Europe.– "Armenian Foreign Policy Between Russia, Iran And U.S." – March 29, 2010{{dead link}} However, the dispute over the Armenian Genocide and the recent war over Nagorno-Karabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Armenia is a member of more than 40 different international organizations including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO's Partnership for Peace, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Trade Organization and La Francophonie. It is also an observer member of the Eurasian Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement. Eduard Nalbandyan currently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.The main factors defining Armenian foreign policy consist from geopolitical location, decreasing population, economic crisis, and ties with Armenian diaspora throughout the world. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and genocide claims for 1915–1918 events made impossible relations with Azerbaijan and Turkey, thus increased an isolation of the country.Reha Yilmaz, Armenian Foreign Policy During Levon Ter-Petrossian and Robert Kocharian Period, Journal of Qafqaz University, no 26, 2009, p.10-11  Armenia landlocked between Georgia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey. So Armenia has to maintain good relations at least with Iran and Georgia though international pressure against trade with Iran and while separatist tends of Armenian minority in Javakheti.{{cite web}}

Armenian Genocide recognition{{Main}}

Armenia has been joined by many nations, in demanding recognition of the Armenian genocide. Countries that officially recognize the Armenian genocide include Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, The Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden,{{cite web}} Switzerland, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela; additionally, some regional governments of countries that do not recognize the Armenian genocide, such as New South Wales in Australia and Wales in the United Kingdom, also officially recognize the Armenian Genocide.  US House Resolution 106 was introduced on January 30, 2007 later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill currently has 225 co-sponsors.http://www3.capwiz.com/y/issues/bills/?billnum=H.RES.106&congress=110{{dead link}} The bill called for former President George W. Bush to recognize and use the word genocide in his annual April 24 speech which he never used. His successor President Barack Obama has expressed his desire to recognize the Armenian Genocide during the electoral campaigns, but after being elected, has not used the word genocide in his first annual April 24 speech in 2009.
Disputes
Nagorno-Karabakh/Azerbaijan{{see also}}
Armenia supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan in the longstanding and very bitter separatist conflict against the Azerbaijani Government.The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against ethnic Azeris in Armenia and ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan. In 1990, after violent episodes in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Baku and Sumgait, Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sent troops to the region, and forcibly occupied Baku, killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian paramilitaries operating in Karabakh. Moscow also deployed troops to Yerevan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was heavily influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring nations in order to keep both under control.More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting from 1992 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized Shusha and Lachin (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in occupying almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the UN Security Council adopted four resolutions calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 when Russia brokered a cease-fire.Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the OSCE. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, sniper-fire, and landmine incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year.{{Citation needed}}Since 1997, the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. One side or the other rejected each of those proposals. Beginning in 1999, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Most recently the OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in Key West, Florida. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell launched the talks on April 3, 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia, and France until April 6, 2001. The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.The two countries are still technically at war.{{Clear}}

The two nations have fought two wars in 1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War) and in 1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War), in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute. In 2008, Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev declared that “Nagorno Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality” and that “in 1918, Yerevan was granted to the Armenians.  It was a great mistake.  The khanate of Iravan was the Azeri territory, the Armenians were guests here”.Azerbaijani president: Armenians are guests in Yerevan, REGNUM News Agency, January 17, 2008

The neighboring nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations since 1918. The two nations have fought two wars in 1918–20 and in 1988–94 in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek. In 2008, Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev declared that “Nagorno Karabakh will never be independent; the position is backed by international mediators as well; Armenia has to accept the reality” and that “in 1918, Yerevan was granted to the Armenians.

During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, the majority of Armenians from the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) of the Azerbaijan SSR began a movement to unify with the Armenian SSR. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The violence resulted in de facto Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France, and Russia and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.{{Citation needed}}

The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of Armenian descent, are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.

{{flag}} 1992-07-17 See Armenia – Georgia relations

Armenians and Georgians have a lot in common.  Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets.  Both use the terms &#34;Apostolic&#34; and &#34;Orthodox&#34; in the full titles of their respective churches.  They also use the term &#34;Catholicos&#34; to refer to their church patriarchs.  Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals).

Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing Karabakh conflict, Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its Black Sea ports. However, because of Armenia&#39;s reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the 2008 South Ossetia war and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia&#39;s imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and South Caucasus natural gas pipeline) have also weighed on the mutual relations and lead to the prevention of the country recognizing the Armenian Genocide. On occasion, however, Georgian politicians have sympathized with the Armenian cause.  For example, on March 20, 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia Revaz Gachechiladze stated, &#34;We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia.&#34;{{cite web}} However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve.  On May 10, 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries.Armenia, Georgia Agree On Greater Part of Border Lines{{dead link}} The Javakheti region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United Javakhk) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.

Since the independence of Armenia the two countries have been partners within the framework of international organizations (United Nations, OSCE, Council of Europe, BSEC), whilst Greece firmly supports the community programs aimed at further developing relations between the EU and Armenia.

Continuous visits of the highest level have shown that both countries want to continue to improve the levels of friendship and cooperation (Visit by the President of Armenia Levon Ter-Petrossian to Greece in 1996, visit by the President of the Hellenic Republic Costis Stephanopoulos in 1999, visit by the President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan to Greece in 2000 and 2005 and visit by Greek president Karolos Papoulias to Armenia in June 2007).

Greece is, after Russia, the major military partner of Armenia. Armenian officers are trained in Greek military academies, and various technical assistance is supplied by Greece.

Russia is the key regional security player, and has proved a valuable historical ally for Armenia.  Although it appeared as a response to Aliyev&#39;s US trip, the treaty had probably long been under development.  However, it is clear from the wider context of Armenian foreign policy that—while Yerevan welcomes the Russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on Moscow, nor to become part of a confrontation between Russian and US-led alliances in the Transcaucasus.

{{flag}} No formal diplomatic relations See Armenia–Turkey relations

Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia&#39;s independence in 1991.  Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons.  Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey&#39;s holding of historic Armenian lands (ceded to them in the Treaty of Kars, a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper).  At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide.  The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from eastern Anatolian lands of the Ottoman Empire orchestrated by the Young Turks is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey.  Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide.

On June 5, 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to &#34;continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions.&#34;{{cite web}}  Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the Armenian SSR, it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.{{cite news}}  Yet Turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations, insisting that Armenia abandon its efforts to have the Genocide recognized, which official Yerevan is not willing to do.

In the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship.  According to The Economist magazine, 70% of Armenia&#39;s imports enter via Georgia.  Because of the apparently belligerent posture of the Russian state, economic ties with Turkey appear especially attractive."Turkey and Armenia; Friends and Neighbors, rising hopes of better relations between two historic enemies", The Economist, September 27, 2008, p. 67

Armenia-Pakistan relations are extraordinarily poor owing to numerous disagreements. The main issue is Armenia&#39;s invasion and occupation of Azerbaijan territories including Nagorno-Karabakh. Pakistan has supported territorial integrity of Azerbaijan during and after the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Pakistan also opposes Armenian irredentist claims against Turkey and Azerbaijan. Pakistan does not recognize the 1915 Genocide and maintains that during the war large number of Armenians and Muslims were killed. Armenia has friendly relations with India, and its recognition of Kashmir belonging to India has also damaged the relations with Pakistan. Pakistan is also the only country that does not recognize Armenia.Pakistan Worldview – Report 21 – Visit to Azerbaijan Senate of Pakistan – Senate foreign relations committee, 2008Nilufer Bakhtiyar: "For Azerbaijan Pakistan does not recognize Armenia as a country" September 13, 2006 [14:03] – Today.Az Pakistan has cultural, ethnic, historical and religious ties with Azerbaijan and Turkey.

The majority came to Australia in the 1960s, starting with the Armenians of Egypt after Nasser came to power then, in the early 1970s, from Cyprus after the Turkish occupation of the island and from 1975 until 1992, a period of civil unrest in Lebanon.
Person-to-person governmental links are increasing although they are still modest. In September 2003, The Hon Mr Philip Ruddock MP visited Armenia in his former capacity as Australian Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. In October 2005, the Armenian Foreign Minister, H.E. Mr Vardan Oskanyan, visited Australia. In November 2005, The Hon Mr Joe Hockey MP, Minister for Human Services, visited Armenia.
The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia refuses to recognise the mass murder of Armenians in 1915 as Genocide, although the State of N.S.W passed a law recognising this several years earlier. The Australian Government elections of 2007 created an atmosphere in which the Opposition Labor party declared it will push for the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide in Australian Parliament if Labor wins the Elections.

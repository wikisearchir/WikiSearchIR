title{{Anglo-Saxon society}}
Anglo-Saxon monarchs were the rulers of the various kingdoms which arose in England following the withdrawal of the Romans in the fifth century.  The most prominent kingdoms were Kent, Sussex, Wessex, Mercia and Bernicia, each recognising their own monarch.  After a considerable period and fluctuations in power balance, Alfred the Great of Wessex was recognised by the other kingdoms as the premier English king.

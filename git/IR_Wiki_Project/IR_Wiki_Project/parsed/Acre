The acre is a unit of area in a number of different systems, including the imperial and U.S. customary systems. The most commonly used acres today are the international acre and, in the United States, the survey acre.  The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land.The acre is related to the square mile, with 640 acres making up one square mile.  One mile is 5280 feet (1760 yards).  Divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile, and fractions thereof.  If the square mile is divided into quarters, each quarter has a side length of 1/2 mile (880 yards) and is 1/4 square mile in area, or 160 acres.  These subunits would typically then again be divided into quarters, with each side being 1/4 mile long, and being 1/16th of a square mile in area, or 40 acres.  In the United States, farmland was typically divided as such, and the phrase "the back 40" would refer to the 40 acre parcel to the back of the farm.  Most of the US midwest is on square mile grids for surveying purposes.One acre comprises 4,840 square yards, 43,560 square feetNational Institute of Standards and Technology (n.d.) General Tables of Units of Measurement or about {{convert}} (see below). While all modern variants of the acre contain 4,840 square yards, there are alternative definitions of a yard, so the exact size of an acre depends on which yard it is based on. Originally, an acre was understood as a selion of land sized at one furlong (660&nbsp;ft) long and one chain (66&nbsp;ft) wide; this may have also been understood as an approximation of the amount of land an ox could plough in one day.  A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards, or {{convert}} on a side.  As a unit of measure, an acre has no prescribed shape; any perimeter enclosing 43,560&nbsp;square feet is an acre in size.The acre is often used to express areas of land in the U.S and in countries where the Imperial System is still in use. {{As of}}, the acre is not used officially in the United Kingdom. In the metric system, the hectare is commonly used for the same purpose. An acre is approximately 40% of a hectare.Perhaps the easiest way to envisage an acre is as a rectangle measuring 88 yards by 55 yards (1/10 of 880 yards by 1/16 of 880 yards), approximately the size of a standard American football field. To be more exact, one acre is 90.75 percent of a {{convert}} long by {{convert}} wide American football field (without the end zones). The full field, including the end zones, covers approximately {{convert}}. The acre is also approximately 56.68 percent of a {{convert}} long by {{convert}} wide Association football (soccer) pitch. It may also be remembered as 44,000 square feet, less 1%; or as the product of 66 × 660.

International acreIn 1958, the United States and countries of the Commonwealth of Nations defined the length of the international yard to be 0.9144 metres.National Bureau of Standards. (1959). Refinement of Values for the Yard and the Pound. Consequently, the international acre is exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres. Since the difference between the U.S. and International acre is only approximately 0.016 square metres (24.8 square inches), it is usually not important which one is being discussed.
United States survey acreThe United States survey acre is approximately 4,046.872 609 874 252 square metres; its exact value ({{frac}} m2) is based on an inch defined by 1 metre = 39.37&nbsp;inches exactly, as established by the Mendenhall Order.

1 United States survey acre is equal to:

4,046.87261 square metres

1&nbsp;acre (both variants) is equal to the following customary units:

66 feet × 660 feet (43,560 square feet)
1 chain × 10 chains (1 chain = 66 feet = 22 yards = 4 rods = 100 links)
1 acre is approximately 208.71 feet × 208.71 feet (a square)
4,840 square yards
160 perches. A perch is equal to a square rod (1 square rod is 0.00625 acre)
10 square chains
4 roods
A chain by a furlong (chain 22 yards, furlong 220 yards)
1/640 (0.0015625) square mile (1 square mile is equal to 640 acres)


Historical origin{{Anthropic_Farm_Units}}
The word "acre" is derived from Old English æcer originally meaning "open field", cognate to west coast Norwegian ækre and Swedish åker, German Acker, Dutch akker, Latin ager, and Greek ????? (agros).The acre was approximately the amount of land tillable by one man behind an ox in one day. This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong. A long narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot, since the plough does not have to be turned so often. The word "furlong" itself derives from the fact that it is one furrow long.Before the enactment of the metric system, many countries in Europe used their own official acres. These were differently sized in different countries, for instance, the historical French acre was 4,221 square metres, whereas in Germany as many variants of "acre" existed as there were German states.Statutory values for the acre were enacted in England, and, subsequently, the United Kingdom, by acts of:

Edward I,
Edward III,
Henry VIII,
George IV and
Queen Victoria – the British Weights and Measures Act of 1878 defined it as containing 4,840 square yards.

Historically, the size of farms and landed estates in the United Kingdom was usually expressed in acres (or acres, roods, and perches), even if the number of acres was so large that it might conveniently have been expressed in square miles. For example, a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land, not 50 square miles of land.
Customary acreThe customary acre was a measure of roughly similar size to the acre described above, but it was subject to considerable local variation similar to the variation found in carucates, virgates, bovates, nooks, and farundels. However, there were more ancient measures that were also farthingales. These may have been multiples of the customary acre, rather than the statute acre.

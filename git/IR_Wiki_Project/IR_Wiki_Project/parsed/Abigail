title{{About}}

Abigail ({{Hebrew Name 2}}, spelt Abigal in {{Bibleref2}}) was the wife of  Nabal; she became a wife of David after Nabal's death (1 Samuel {{Bibleref2-nb}}).In the passage, Nabal demonstrates ingratitude towards David, and Abigail attempts to placate David in order to stop him taking revenge. She gives him food, and speaks to him, urging him not to "have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed" (verse 31, NIV) and reminding him that God will make him a "lasting dynasty" (verse 28). Jon Levenson calls this an "undeniable adumbration" of Nathan's prophecy in 2 Samuel 7.Jon D. Levenson, "1 Samuel 25 as Literature and History," CBQ 40 [1978] 20. Alice Bach notes that Abigail pronounces a "crucial prophecy,"Alice Bach, "The Pleasure of Her Text," Union Seminary Quarterly Review 43 [1989] 44. and the Talmud regards her as one of the Tanakh's seven female prophets.Megillah 14a Levenson, however, suggests that she "senses the drift of history" from intelligence rather than from special revelation.In verse 38, it says that "YHWH struck Nabal and he died," and David subsequently married Abigail.

The text explicitly describes Abigail as "intelligent and beautiful" (1 Samuel 25:3, NIV). Indeed, the Talmud mentions her as being one of the "four women of surpassing beauty in the world."Megillah 15a Abraham Kuyper argues, moreover, that Abigail's conduct indicates "a most appealing character and unwavering faith."Abraham Kuyper, Women of the Old Testament (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1941), 106. Yet Alice Bach regards her as subversive,Alice Bach, "The Pleasure of Her Text," Union Seminary Quarterly Review 43 [1989] 41. while Sandra Williams suggests that Abigail is deceptive and disloyal to her husband and even that she was "sexually turned on by an outlaw and a criminal."Sandra S. Williams, David and Abigail: A Non-Traditional ViewAbigail was the mother of one of David's sons, who is named in the Book of Chronicles as Daniel,{{bibleverse}} in the Masoretic Text of the Books of Samuel as Chileab,{{bibleverse}} and in the Septuagint text of 2 Samuel 3:3 as ???????, Dalouia.2 Samuel 3, LXXLevenson and Halpern suggest that Abigail may, in fact, be the same person as Abigail, mother of Amasa.Jon D. Levenson and Baruch Halpern, "The Political Import of David's Marriages," JBL 99 [1980] 511-512.
Generic useAbigail's self-styling as a handmaid{{bibleverse}} and following led to Abigail being the traditional term for a waiting-woman, for example as the waiting gentlewoman in Beaumont and Fletcher's The Scornful Lady, published in 1616. Jonathan Swift and Henry Fielding use Abigail in this generic sense, as does Charlotte Brontë. Anthony Trollope makes two references to the abigail (all lower case) in The Eustace Diamonds, at the beginning of Chapter 42. William Rose Benet notes the notoriety of Abigail Hill, better known as "Mrs Masham", a lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne.The Reader's Encyclopedia, 1948, s.v. "Abigail".

History
The beginning{{Main}}
The club was originally founded as a football team in 1891, with the name Buenos Aires English High School although it was obligued to change its name to Alumni Athletic Club (the name was proposed by a former student of the English High School) in 1901.Alumni was the most successful team in the amateur era of Argentine football, winning 10 of the 14 league championships contested, being considered the first great team in Argentine football "En el nombre del fútbol", [[Clarín] newspaper, 2003-04-24]. Alumni was reorganised in 1908, "in order to encourage people to practise all kind of sports, specially football". This was the last try to develop itself as a sports club rather than just a football team, such as Lomas, Belgrano and Quilmes had successfully done in the past, but the efforts were not enough. Alumni played its last game in 1911 and was definitely dissolved on April 24, 1913. 
Rebirth through rugbyIn 1951 the English High School asked its former students for permission to re-establish the name "Alumni" for a rugby team. This request was immediately approved in a meeting presided by Carlos Bowers, who had proposed the name "Alumni" to the original football team 50 years before. "Los comienzos de Alumni" - club's official websiteThe team achieved good results and in 1960 the club presented a team that won the third division of the Buenos Aires league, reaching the second division. Since then, Alumni has played at the highest level of Argentinian rugby and its rivalry with Belgrano Athletic Club is one of the fiercest local derbies in Buenos Aires. Alumni would later climb up to first division winning 5 titles: 4 consecutive between 1989 and 1992, and the other in 2001.In 2002, Alumni won its first Nacional title, defeating Jockey of Rosario 23-21 in the final.

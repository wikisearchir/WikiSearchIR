Crandall University is a small Liberal Arts university located in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada.  Crandall is operated by the Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches.
HistoryThe school was founded in 1949 under the name United Baptist Bible Training School (UBBTS), and served as both a secondary school and a Bible school. Over two decades, the focus of the school gradually shifted toward post-secondary programs. In 1968, UBBTS became a Bible and junior Christian liberal arts college, and in 1970 the name was changed to Atlantic Baptist College (ABC). A sustained campaign to expand the school's faculty and improve the level of education resulted in ABC being able to grant full Bachelor of Arts degrees in the early 1980s.  Its campus at this time was located along the Salisbury Road, west of Moncton's central business district.The institution moved to a new campus constructed on the Gorge Road, north of the central business district, in 1996. The name was also changed to Atlantic Baptist University, a reflection of expanded student enrollment and academic accreditation. ABU sports teams play under the name Blue Tide. The institution was the first, and thus far only, English university in Moncton.  The Atlantic Baptist University Act was passed by the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick in 2008.http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/FILE/56/2/Bill-64-e.htm Atlantic Baptist University ActIn 2009, plans for a $24 million expansion to the campus, including a new academic building, a second residence and a sports complex were unveiled. Construction is currently underway. The expansion will allow the student enrollment to increase to 1200.On August 21, 2009 it was announced that the institution had changed its name to Crandall University in honour of Rev. Joseph Crandall, a pioneering Baptist minister in New Brunswick.http://www.cbc.ca/canada/new-brunswick/story/2009/08/21/nb-atlantic-baptist-university-crandall-557.html Atlantic Baptist University changes name

title{{About}}
{{Infobox given name2}}Alexandra ({{lang-el}}) is the feminine form of the given name Alexander, which is a romanization of the Greek name ?????????? (Alexandros). Etymologically, the name is a compound of the Greek verb ??????? (alexein) "to defend" and the noun ?????? (andros), genitive of ???? (an?r) "man". Thus it may be roughly translated as "protector of man". The name was one of the titles ("epithets") given to the Greek goddess Hera and as such is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek a-re-ka-sa-da-ra, written in Linear B syllabic script.a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (Alexandra) Palaeolexicon, Word study tool of ancient languagesThe Mycenaean World, by John Chadwick, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1976, 1999

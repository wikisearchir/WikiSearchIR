The alkali metals are a series of chemical elements in the periodic table. In the modern IUPAC nomenclature, the alkali metals comprise the group 1 elements, along with hydrogen. The alkali metals are lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr).{{RedBook2005}}. Hydrogen (H), although nominally also a member of group 1, rarely exhibits behavior comparable to the alkali metals. This group lies in the s-block of the periodic table; all alkali metals' outermost electrons lie in an s-orbital. The alkali metals provide one of the best examples of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well characterized homologous behavior. For instance, when moving down the table, all alkali metals show decreasing electronegativity, increasing reactivity, and decreasing melting and boiling points. In general, their densities increase, with the notable exception that potassium is less dense than sodium.All discovered alkali metals are naturally occurring, although francium is the second-rarest naturally occurring element, after astatine. All are highly reactive metals under standard conditions. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium (Uue), likely the next member of the group, but have all met with failure.{{cite journal}} Most alkali metals have many different applications. Two of the most well-known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium atomic clocks, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate representation of time known as of 2012. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the sodium vapor lamp, which emit very efficient light. Table salt, or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. The alkali metals can also be used as fertilizers.
Hydrogen{{Main}}
The element hydrogen, with one electron per neutral atom, is usually placed at the top of Group 1 of the periodic table for convenience, but hydrogen is not usually considered as an alkali metal. Under typical conditions, pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule (H2).Hydrogen, like the other alkali metals, has one valence electron; however, the similarities end there. In fact, its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration and not its chemical properties.{{cite web}} It is sometimes placed above carbon due to similar electronegativity or fluorine due to similar chemical properties.{{cite journal}}The first ionization energy of hydrogen is much higher than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion. Binary compounds of hydrogen with the alkali metals and some transition metals have been produced in the laboratory,{{cite journal}} but these are only laboratory curiosities without any practical use. Under extremely high pressures and low temperatures, however, such as those found at the cores of the planets Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic{{cite journal}} and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen.
Characteristics
Chemical
Like other groups, the members of this family show patterns in its electronic configuration, especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior:

Z  Element  No. of electrons/shell  Electron configuration 
3  lithium  2, 1  [He]2s1 
11  sodium  2, 8, 1  [Ne]3s1 
19  potassium  2, 8, 8, 1  [Ar]4s1 
37  rubidium  2, 8, 18, 8, 1  [Kr]5s1 
55  caesium  2, 8, 18, 18, 8, 1  [Xe]6s1 
87  francium  2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 8, 1  [Rn]7s1 
Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. All the alkali metals are all highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil).{{cite journal}}




The alkali metals are all silver-colored except for metallic caesium, which can have a golden tint. All are soft and have low density, melting points, and boiling points. In chemical terms, all of the alkali metals react aggressively with the halogens to form ionic salts and also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones. For example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionization energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. The second ionization energy of all of the alkali metals is very high, thus they almost always lose a single electron, forming cations.Alkali metals form a very wide range of amalgams.{{Cite journal}}
They tend to form ionically bonded salts with most electronegative elements on the periodic table, for example caesium fluoride and sodium chloride.The ammonium ion (NH{{su}}) has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals and is often considered a close relative.{{Holleman&Wiberg}}
Physical and atomicThe table below is a summary of the key physical properties of the alkali metals. The density of Francium is an estimation partially based on periodic trends rather than observations.

History
Lithium
Petalite (LiAlSi4O10) was discovered in 1800 by the Brazilian chemist José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva in a mine on the island of Utö, Sweden.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{Cite book}} However, it was not until 1817 that Johan August Arfwedson, then working in the laboratory of the chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius, detected the presence of a new element while analyzing petalite ore.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} This new element formed compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium, though its carbonate and hydroxide were less soluble in water and more alkaline than the other alkali metals.{{cite web}} Berzelius gave the unknown material the name "lithion/lithina", from the Greek word ???o? (transliterated as lithos, meaning "stone"), to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral, as opposed to potassium, which had been discovered in plant ashes, and sodium, which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood. He named the metal inside the material "lithium".{{Cite book}}
Sodium
Sodium has been known since ancient times; salt has been an important commodity in human activities, as testified by the English word salary, referring to salarium, the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe a compound of sodium with the Latin name of sodanum was used as a headache remedy. Pure sodium was not isolated until 1807 by Humphry Davy through the electrolysis of caustic soda,{{cite journal}} a very similar method to the one used to isolate potassium earlier that year.
Potassium
While potash has been used since ancient times, it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts. Georg Ernst Stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in 1702,{{cite book}} and Henri Louis Duhamel du Monceau was able to prove this difference in 1736.{{cite journal}} The exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds, and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium, was not known then, and thus Antoine Lavoisier did include the alkali in his list of chemical elements in 1789.{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}} Pure potassium was first isolated in 1807 in England by Sir Humphry Davy, who derived it from caustic potash (KOH) by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile. Potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis.{{cite book}} Later that same year, Davy reported extraction of the metal sodium from the similar substance caustic soda (NaOH, or lye) by a similar technique, demonstrating the elements, and thus the salts, to be different.{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}}
Rubidium
Rubidium was discovered in 1861 in Heidelberg, Germany by Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff, the first people to suggest finding new elements by spectrum analysis, in the mineral lepidolite through the use of a spectroscope. Because of the bright red lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word rubidus, meaning dark red.{{Cite journal}}{{Cite journal}} Rubidium's discovery succeeded that of caesium, also discovered by Bunsen and Kirchhoff through spectroscopy.
CaesiumIn 1860, Robert Bunsen and Gustav Kirchhoff discovered caesium in the mineral water from Dürkheim, Germany. Due to the bright-blue lines in its emission spectrum, they chose a name derived from the Latin word caesius, meaning sky-blue.{{cite journal}}Bunsen quotes Aulus Gellius Noctes Atticae II, 26 by Nigidius Figulus: Nostris autem veteribus caesia dicts est quae Graecis, ut Nigidus ait, de colore coeli quasi coelia.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition Caesium was the first element to be discovered spectroscopically, only one year after the invention of the spectroscope by Bunsen and Kirchhoff.{{cite web}}
FranciumThere were at least three erroneous and incomplete discoveries{{cite conference}}{{cite web}}{{cite news}}{{cite journal}} before Marguerite Perey of the Curie Institute in Paris, France discovered Francium in 1939 by purifying a sample of actinium-227, which had been reported to have a decay energy of 220&nbsp;keV. However, Perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below 80&nbsp;keV. Perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product, one that was separated during purification, but emerged again out of the pure actinium-227. Various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium, radium, lead, bismuth, or thallium. The new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal (such as coprecipitating with caesium salts), which led Perey to believe that it was element 87, caused by the alpha decay of actinium-227.Adloff, Jean-Pierre; Kaufman, George B. (2005-09-25). Francium (Atomic Number 87), the Last Discovered Natural Element. The Chemical Educator 10 (5). Retrieved on 2007-03-26. Perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in actinium-227. Her first test put the alpha branching at 0.6%, a figure that she later revised to 1%.{{Cite book}}
Eka-francium{{see also}}
The next element below francium (eka-francium) is likely to be ununennium (Uue), element 119, although this is not certain. The synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in 1985 by bombarding a target of einsteinium-254 with calcium-48 ions at the superHILAC accelerator at Berkeley, California. No atoms were identified, leading to a limiting yield of 300 nb.{{cite web}}\,^{254}_{99}\mathrm{Es} + \,^{48}_{20}\mathrm{Ca} \to \,^{302}_{119}\mathrm{Uue} ^{*} \to \ 
 \ no\ atoms
It is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future, given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of 254Es to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required level; einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories. However, given that ununennium is only the first period 8 element on the extended periodic table, it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions. Currently, none of the period 8 elements have been discovered yet. It is also possible that, due to drip instabilities, only the lower period 8 elements are physically possible.
Production{{multiple image}}
The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs, brine pools, and brine deposits. The metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride.{{cite web}}Potassium is occasionally produced through separating the potassium from the chlorine in potassium chloride, but is more often produced through electrolysis of potassium hydroxide,{{cite web}} found extensively in places such as Canada, Russia, Belarus, Germany, Israel, United States, and Jordan, in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late 1800s and early 1900s.Eggeman, Tim. Sodium and Sodium Alloys. Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Published online 2007. {{doi}} Sodium is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below 700&nbsp;°C through the use of a Downs Cell.{{Cite book}}{{cite web}} Extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azide.Merck Index, 9th ed., monograph 8325
For several years in the 1950s and 1960s, a by-product of the potassium production called Alkarb was a main source for rubidium. Alkarb contained 21% rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium.{{cite journal}} Today the largest producers of caesium, for example the  Tanco Mine, Manitoba, Canada, produce rubidium as by-product from pollucite. Today, a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization of a rubidium and caesium alum (Cs,Rb)Al(SO4)2·12H2O, which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately 30 different reactions.{{cite book}} The limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limits the production of rubidium compounds to 2 to 4 tonnes per year.{{cite web}} Caesium, however, is not produced from the above reaction. Instead, the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium, extracted from the ore mainly by three methods: acid digestion, alkaline decomposition, and direct reduction.{{cite book}}
Francium-223 is the only naturally occurring isotope of francium, produced naturally as the product of the alpha decay of actinium-227. Francium can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals; it has been calculated that at most there are 30&nbsp;g of francium in the earth's crust at any given time.{{cite web}} This makes it the second rarest element in the crust after astatine. As a result of its extreme rarity in nature, most francium is synthesized in the nuclear reaction 197Au + 18O ? 210Fr + 5 n, yielding francium-209, francium-210, and francium-211.{{cite journal}}As of 2012, all attempts at the synthesis of ununennium have been met with failure.
OccurrenceThe alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature. Lithium, due to its relatively low reactivity, can be found in seawater in large amounts; it is estimated that seawater is approximately 0.14 to 0.25 parts per million (ppm){{cite web}}{{cite web}} or 25 micromolar.{{cite journal}}Sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth; sodium makes up approximately 2.6% of the Earth's crust measured by weight, making it the sixth most abundant element overall{{RubberBible86th}} and the most abundant alkali metal. Potassium makes up approximately 1.5% of the Earth's crust and is the seventh most abundant element. Sodium is found in many different minerals, of which the most common is ordinary salt (sodium chloride), which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater. Other solid deposits include halite, amphibole, cryolite, soda niter, and zeolite.Caesium is more abundant than some commonly known elements, such as antimony, cadmium, tin, and tungsten, but is much less abundant than rubidium. Rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper. It occurs naturally in the minerals leucite, pollucite, carnallite, zinnwaldite, and lepidolite.{{Cite journal}}Francium-223, the only naturally occurring isotope of francium,{{cite journal}} is the result of the alpha decay of actinium-227 and can be found in trace amounts in uranium and thorium minerals{{Cite book}} In a given sample of uranium, there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every 1×1018 uranium atoms.{{cite book}}{{cite web}} It has been calculated that there is at most 30&nbsp;g of francium in the earth's crust at any time, due to its extremely short half-life of 22 minutes, making it the second-rarest element in the crust after astatine.{{cite web}}Ununennium does not occur naturally in nature, and until it is synthesized in laboratories, it is not likely that any exists on earth.
ApplicationsAll of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications. Lithium is often used in batteries, and lithium oxide can help process silica. Lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases, air treatment, and aluminium production.{{Cite news}}Pure sodium has many applications, including use in sodium-vapor lamps, which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting,{{cite book}}{{cite book}} and can help smooth the surface of other metals.{{cite book}}{{cite book}} Sodium compounds have many applications as well, the most well-known compound being table salt. Sodium is also used in soap as salts of fatty acids.Potassium is often used as a fertilizer,{{cite book}} as it is an important element for plant nutrition. Other potassium ions are often used to hold anions. Potassium hydroxide is a very strong base, and is used to control pH of various substances{{cite book}}Schultz, p. 95Rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks.{{cite web}} Caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily accurate; if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs, it would be off by less than two seconds.{{cite web}} For that reason, cesium atoms are used as the definition of the second.{{cite web}} Rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks,{{Cite journal}} and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry.{{cite book}}Francium has no commercial applications,{{cite web}} but because of francium's relatively simple atomic structure, among other things, it has been used in spectroscopy experiments, leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles.{{cite journal}} Studies on the light emitted by laser-trapped francium-210 ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels, similar to those predicted by quantum theory.{{cite journal}}
Biological occurrences
The lighter alkali metals all have a role in the human body.  Lithium carbonate is a mood stabilizer and is used to treat bipolar disorder (manic-depression), although there are side-effects. Excessive ingestion of lithium poisons the central nervous system, which is even more dangerous than the disorder itself, as the lethal dose is only just above the therapeutic dose.{{cite web}}Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day.{{cite web}} Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods.{{cite web}} The DRI for sodium is 1.5&nbsp;grams per day,{{cite web}} but most people in the United States consume more than 2.3&nbsp;grams per day,{{cite book}} the minimum amount that promotes hypertension;{{cite journal}} this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.{{cite journal}}Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane. All potassium ion channels are tetramers with several conserved secondary structural elements. The most recently resolved potassium ion channel is KirBac3.1, which gives a total of five potassium ion channels (KcsA, KirBac1.1, KirBac3.1, KvAP, MthK) with a determined structure.{{cite journal}} All five are from prokaryotic species. The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action potential&mdash;a "spike" of electrical discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function.Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism,{{cite journal}}{{cite journal}} and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium in the body causing potassium deficiency.Caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic because of chemical similarity of caesium to potassium. Exposure to large amounts of caesium compounds can cause hyperirritability and spasms, but as such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources, caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant.{{cite journal}} The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3&nbsp;g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride.{{cite journal}} Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy,{{cite journal}} but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.Wood, Leonie. {{Cite web}} Francium has no biological role{{cite web}} and is most likely to be toxic due to its high radioactivity, although the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is   about 300,000 neutral atoms.{{cite journal}}

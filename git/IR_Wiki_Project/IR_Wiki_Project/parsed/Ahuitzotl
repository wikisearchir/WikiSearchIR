title{{Redirect}}{{Infobox Nahua officeholder}}Ahuizotl ({{lang-nah}}, {{IPA-nah}}) (meaning roughly "water dog"http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/names/natamnames2.htm) was the eighth  Aztec ruler, the Hueyi Tlatoani,  of the city of Tenochtitlan.  He was responsible for much of the expansion of the Mexica domain, and consolidated the empire's power after emulating his predecessor.  He took power as Tlatoani in the year 7 Rabbit (1486), after the death of his predecessor Tízoc.Perhaps the greatest known military leader of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, Ahuizotl began his reign by suppressing a Huastec rebellion, and then swiftly more than doubled the size of lands under Aztec dominance.  He conquered the Mixtec, Zapotec, and other peoples from Mexico's Pacific coast down to the western part of Guatemala.  Ahuizotl also supervised a major rebuilding of Tenochtitlan on a grander scale including the expansion of the Great Pyramid or Templo Mayor in the year 8 Reed (1487).
Ahuizotl died in the year 10 Rabbit (1502) and was succeeded by his nephew, Moctezuma II.Ahuizotl took his name from the animal Ahuizotl, which the Aztecs apparently{{fact}} considered to be a legendary creature in its own right rather than a mere mythical representation of the king.

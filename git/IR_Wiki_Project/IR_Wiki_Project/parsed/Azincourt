{{Infobox French commune}}Azincourt ({{IPA-fr}}; historically, Agincourt in English) is a commune in the Pas-de-Calais department in northern France.
GeographySituated 12 miles (20&nbsp;km) north-west of Saint-Pol-sur-Ternoise on the D71 road.

EtymologyThe town's name is attested as Aisincurt in 1175, derived from a Germanic masculine name Aizo, Aizino and the early Northern French word curt 'farm with a courtyard' (Late Latin cortem).  It has no etymological connection in French with Agincourt, Meurthe-et-Moselle (attested as Egincourt 875), which is derived from another Germanic male name *Ingin-.fr:Albert Dauzat et fr:Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France, éditions Larousse 1968. p. 4.
HistoryAzincourt is famous as the site of the battle fought on 25 October 1415 in which the army led by King Henry V of England defeated the forces led by Charles d'Albret on behalf of Charles VI of France, and recorded in English history as the Battle of Agincourt.  According to M. Forrest, the French knights were so encumbered by their armour that they were exhausted even before the start of the battle. The House of Commons: 1509 - 1558, Volume 4; Stanley T. Bindoff, John S. Roskell, Lewis Namier, Romney Sedgwick, David Hayton, Eveline Cruickshanks, R. G. Thorne, P. W. Hasler (Boydell & Brewer, 1982)Later on, when he became King in 1509, Henry VIII commended{{what}} an English version of the Life of Henry V so that he could emulate him, on the grounds that he thought that launching a campaign against France would help him to impose himself on the European stage. In 1513, Henry VIII conclusively crossed the English Channel and stopped at Azincourt. He was notably accompanied by John Nevill.

Places of interestThe original battlefield museum in the village featured model knights made out of Action Man figures. However, this has now been replaced by a more professional exhibition space incorporating laser, video, slide shows, audio commentaries, and some interactive elements. The museum building is shaped like a longbow similar to those used at the battle by archers under King Henry.{{as of}}, a festival commemorating local history has been held in the village once in every year or two since 2004,"Videos from Azincourt" at Azincourt Alliance on a weekend in the summer.

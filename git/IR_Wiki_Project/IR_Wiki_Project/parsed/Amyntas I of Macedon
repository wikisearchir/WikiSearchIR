title{{Infobox person}}Amyntas I (Greek: ??????? A?, c. 540-498 BC) was a king of Macedon. He was a son of Alcetas I of Macedon and his queen. He married a woman called Eurydice and had a son Alexander. Amyntas was a tributary vassal of Darius Hystaspes of Persia. With him the history of Macedon may be said to begin. He was the first of its rulers to have relations with other countries; he entered into an alliance with Hippias of Athens, and when Hippias was driven out of Athens he offered him the territory of Anthemus on the Thermaic Gulf. Hippias refused it and Iolcos as well, the Thessalian offer, as Amyntas probably did not possess Anthemous at that time, but was merely suggesting a plan of joint occupation to Hippias.Miltiades V.

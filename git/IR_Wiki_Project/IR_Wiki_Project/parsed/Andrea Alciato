titleAndrea Alciato (May 8, 1492 – January 12, 1550),{{cite book}} commonly known as Alciati (Andreas Alciatus), was an Italian jurist and writer.D. Bianchi, 1913. "L'opera letteraria e storica di Andrea Alciato", Archivio storico lombardo, 4th series20:47-57.  He is regarded as the founder of the French school of legal humanists.
BiographyAlciati was born in Alzate Brianza, near Milan, and settled in France in the early 16th century. He displayed great literary skill in his exposition of the laws, and was one of the first to interpret the civil law by the history, languages and literature of antiquity, and to substitute original research for the servile interpretations of the glossators. He published many legal works, and some annotations on Tacitus and accumulated a sylloge of Roman inscriptions from Milan and its territories, as part of his preparation for his history of Milan, written in 1504-05.Roberto Weiss, 1969. The Renaissance Discovery of Antiquity, pp 152f. 

Alciati is most famous for his Emblemata, published in dozens of editions from 1531 onward. This collection of short Latin verse texts and accompanying woodcuts created an entire European genre, the emblem book, which attained enormous popularity in continental Europe and Great Britain.Alciati died at Pavia in 1550.

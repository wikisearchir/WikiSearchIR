title{{Unreferenced}}{{main}}"American shot" is a translation of a phrase from French film criticism, "plan américain" and refers to a medium-long ("knee") film shot of a group of characters, who are arranged so that all are visible to the camera. The usual arrangement is for the actors to stand in an irregular line from one side of the screen to the other, with the actors at the end coming forward a little and standing more in profile than the others. The purpose of the composition is to allow complex dialogue scenes to be played out without changes in camera position. In some literature, this is simply referred to as a 3/4 shot.The French critics thought it was characteristic of American films of the 1930s or 1940s; however, it was mostly characteristic of cheaper American movies, such as Charlie Chan mysteries where people collected in front of a fireplace or at the foot of the stairs in order to explain what happened a few minutes ago.Howard Hawks legitimized this style in his films, allowing characters to act, even when not talking, when most of the audience would not be paying attention. It became his trademark style.
In Popular Culture"The American Shot is a New York-based online magazine of cultural criticism. We publish features, reviews, and essays on diverse media of cultural production. Despite the great and many connotations of our title, we unfortunately do not trade in espresso, alcohol, firearms, or American nationalism. Rather, we take our name from the English translation of the term coined by French film critics to describe a convention in American B movies of the 1930s and ‘40s. The American Shot denotes a medium-long shot framing a group of characters so they are simultaneously visible to the camera. The composition allows for dialogue and discussion to be played out in a single frame. Following this deliberately open and discursive structure, we hope to be a platform for critique that is at once intrepid and irreverent, reflective and playful."http://theamericanshot.com/

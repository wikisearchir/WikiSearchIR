Soon, they signed with BMG Ricordi and started to mix their rap with pop music, obtaining great success and popularity. However, the underground hip hop scene positioned them as traitors.{{Citation needed}} Their producer was Franco Godi, who also produced the music for the Signor Rossi animated series.In 1997, DJ Gruff dissed Articolo 31 in a track titled 1 vs 2 appearing on the first album of the beatmaker Fritz da Cat, but Articolo 31's lawyers obtained a retraction of the record, and its reissue without the song.{{Citation needed}}In 2001, Articolo 31 collaborated with the American old school rapper Kurtis Blow on the album XChé SI!. In the same year, they made the movie Senza filtro (in English, "Without filter").With Domani smetto, Articolo 31 left the world of hip hop and moved to rap with many influences; even more so than previously, this album found them rapping and singing to rock and pop tracks.In recent years, J Ax and DJ Jad have each released solo records, and in 2006, the group declared an indefinite hiatus.Their posse, Spaghetti Funk, includes other popular performers like Space One and pop rappers Gemelli DiVersi.

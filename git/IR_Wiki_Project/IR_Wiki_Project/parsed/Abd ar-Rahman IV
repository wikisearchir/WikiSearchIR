Abd ar-Rahman IV Mortada (?????????) was the Caliph of Cordoba in the Umayyad dynasty of the Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia), succeeding Suleiman II, in 1018. That same year, he was murdered at Cadiz while fleeing from a battle in which he had been deserted by the very supporters which had brought him into power. His brief reign was similar to that of Abd ar-Rahman V Mostadir.{{s-start}}

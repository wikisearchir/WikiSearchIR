{{Wiktionary}}In many legal jurisdictions related to English common law, affray is a public order offence consisting of the fighting of two or more persons in a public place to the terror (in {{lang-fr}}) of ordinary people (the lieges).  Depending on their actions, and the laws of the prevailing jurisdiction, those engaged in an affray may also render themselves liable to prosecution for assault, unlawful assembly, or riot; if so, it is for one of these offences that they are usually charged."Affray", Encyclopædia Britannica, 1911

AustraliaThe Queensland Criminal Code of 1899 (sect. 72) defines affray as taking part in a fight in a public highway or taking part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access.  This definition is taken from that in the English Criminal Code Bill of 1880, cl. 96.  Section 72 says "Any person who takes part in a fight in a public place, or takes part in a fight of such a nature as to alarm the public in any other place to which the public have access, commits a misdemeanour. Maximum penalty—1 year’s imprisonment.""Queensland Criminal Code Act 1899", retrieved 22nd July 2009 from the website of the Office of the Queensland Parliamentary Counsel

Story County was chosen as the location on June 21, 1859, from proposals by Johnson, Kossuth, Marshall, Polk, and Story counties. When Iowa accepted the provisions of the Morrill Act of 1862, Iowa State became the first institution in nation designated as a land-grant college. The institution was coeducational from the first preparatory class admitted in 1868. The formal admitting of students began the following year, and the first graduating class of 1872 consisted of 24 men and 2 women.The first building on the Iowa State campus was Farm House.

Infrastructure
Transportation
The town is served by U.S. Highways 30 and 69 and Interstate 35.  Ames is the only town in Iowa with a population of greater than 50,000 that does not have a state highway serving it.Ames was serviced by the Fort Dodge, Des Moines and Southern Railroad via a branch from Kelley to Iowa State University and to downtown Ames.  The tracks were removed in the 1960s.  The Chicago and North Western Transportation Company twin mainline runs east and west bisecting the town and running just south of the downtown business district.  The C&NW used to operate a branch to Des Moines.  This line was removed in the 1980s when the Spine Line through Nevada was purchased from the Rock Island Railroad after its bankruptcy.  The Union Pacific, successor to the C&NW, still runs 60–70 trains a day through Ames on twin mainlines, which leads to some traffic delays. There is also a branch to Eagle Grove that leaves Ames to the north. The Union Pacific maintains a small yard called Ames Yard east of Ames between Ames and Nevada.  Ames has been testing automatic train horns at several of its crossings.  These directional horns which are focused down the streets are activated when the crossing signals turn on and are shut off after the train crosses the crossing.  This system cancels out the need for the trains to blow their horns.  Train noise had been a problem in the residential areas to the west and northwest of downtown.Ames has a municipal airport located {{convert}} southeast of the city.  The current (and only) FBO is Hap's Air Service, a company which has been based at the airport since 1975.  The airport has four runways – 01/19, which is 5700x100 feet, and 13/31, which is 3492x100 feet.The City of Ames offers a transit system throughout town, called CyRide, that is funded jointly by Iowa State University, the ISU Government of the Student Body, and the City of Ames.  Rider fares are subsidized through this funding, and are free to students and youth.Ames has the headquarters of the Iowa Department of Transportation."Where We Are Located."

PoliticsIowa is a "battleground state" that has trended slightly Democratic in recent years, and Ames, like Iowa City, also trends Democratic.  Because Iowa is the first caucus state and Ames is a college town, it is the site of many political appearances, debates and events, especially during election years.During every August in which the Republican presidential nomination is undecided (meaning there is no incumbent Republican president—as in, most recently, 2011, 2007, 1999, 1995 and 1987), the town plays host to the Ames Straw Poll, which gauges support for the various Republican candidates amongst attendees of a fundraising dinner benefiting the Iowa Republican Party.  The straw poll dates back to 1979, and is frequently seen as a first test of organizational strength in Iowa by the national media and party insiders; as such, it can be very beneficial for a candidate to win the straw poll and thus enhance the candidate's aura of inevitability or show off a superior field operation.{{cite news}}

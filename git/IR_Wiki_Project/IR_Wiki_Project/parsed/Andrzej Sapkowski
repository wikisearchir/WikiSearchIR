title{{Infobox writer}}Andrzej Sapkowski, born 21 June 1948 in ?ód?, is a Polish fantasy writer. He is best known for his best-selling book series The Witcher.
BiographySapkowski studied economics, and before turning to writing, he had worked as a senior sales representative for a foreign trade company. His first short story, The Witcher (Wied?min), was published in Fantastyka, Poland's leading fantasy literary magazine, in 1986 and  was enormously successful both with readers and critics. Sapkowski has created a cycle of tales based on the world of The Witcher, comprising three collections of short stories and five novels. This cycle and his many other works have made him one of the best-known fantasy authors in Poland in the 1990s.The main character of The Witcher (alternative translations: The Hexer and Spellmaker) is Geralt, a mutant assassin who has been trained since childhood to hunt down and destroy monsters. Geralt exists in a morally ambiguous universe, yet manages to maintain his own coherent code of ethics. At the same time cynical and noble, Geralt has been compared to Raymond Chandler's signature character Philip Marlowe.{{pl icon}} Marek Oramus Jedynie s?uszny wizerunek wied?mina,  Polityka - nr 36 (2261) from 2000-09-02; p. 52-54 The world in which these adventures take place is heavily influenced by Slavic mythology.The Last Wish by Andrzej Sapkowski, fantasybookreviewSapkowski has won five Zajdel Awards, including three for short stories "Mniejsze z?o" (Lesser Evil) (1990), "Miecz przeznaczenia" (Sword of Destiny) (1992) and "W leju po bombie" (In a Bomb Crater) (1993), and two for the novels "Krew elfów" (Blood of Elves) (1994) and "Narrenturm" (2002).

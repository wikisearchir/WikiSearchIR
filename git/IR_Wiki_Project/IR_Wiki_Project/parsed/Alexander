Alexander ({{IPAc-en}}) is a common male first name, and less common surname. The most famous is Alexander III of Macedon, commonly known as Alexander the Great, who created one of the largest empires in ancient history.
OriginEtymologically, the name is derived from the Greek "??????????" (Aléxandros), meaning "defending men" ??????????, 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library or "protector of men", a compound of the verb "?????" (alex?), "to ward off, to avert, to defend"?????, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library and the noun "??????" (andros), genitive of "????" (an?r), "man".????, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Digital Library It is an example of the widespread motif of Greek (or Indo-European more generally) names expressing "battle-prowess", in this case the ability to withstand or push back an enemy battle line.The earliest attested form of the name is the Mycenaean Greek feminine noun a-re-ka-sa-da-ra, (transliterated as Alexandra), written in Linear B syllabic script.a-re-ka-sa-da-ra (Alexandra) Palaeolexicon,
Word study tool of ancient languagesMycenaean (Linear B)&nbsp;– English GlossaryThe Mycenaean World, John Chadwick, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1976, 1999 The name was one of the titles ("epithets") given to the Greek goddess Hera and as such is usually taken to mean "one who comes to save warriors". In the Iliad, the character Paris is known also as Alexander.??????????, 
Georg Autenrieth, A Homeric Dictionary, on Perseus Digital Library The name's popularity was spread throughout the Greek world by the military conquests of King Alexander III, commonly known as "Alexander the Great". Most later Alexanders in various countries were directly or indirectly named for him.{{citation needed}}

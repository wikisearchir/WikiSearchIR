Alfred Elton van Vogt (April 26, 1912&nbsp;– January 26, 2000) was a Canadian-born science fiction author regarded by some{{Who}} as one of the most popular and complex"Although [van Vogt] catered for the pulps, he intensified the emotional impact and complexity of the stories they would bear[.]" {{cite book}} science fiction writers of the mid-twentieth century: the "Golden Age" of the genre.
Early life and writingsVan Vogt was born on a farm in Edenburg, a Russian Mennonite community east of Gretna, Manitoba, Canada. Until he was four years old, van Vogt and his family spoke only a dialect of Low German in the home.Panshin, Alexei “Man Beyond Man. The Early Stories of A. E. van Vogt” page 1 Retrieved on 2010-08-29 Van Vogt's father, a lawyer, moved his family several times and his son found these moves difficult, remarking in later life:{{quote}}After starting his writing career by writing for "true confession" style pulp magazines like True Story, van Vogt decided to switch to writing something he enjoyed, science fiction.Elliot, Jeffery: “An Interview with A. E. Van Vogt”, Science Fiction Review #23, 1977. Available online http://www.angelfire.com/art/megathink/vanvogt/vanvogt_interview.html Retrieved on 2010-08-29Van Vogt's first published SF story, "Black Destroyer" (Astounding Science Fiction, July 1939), was inspired by Voyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin.Drake, H. L.: "A. E. van Vogt: Science Fantasy's Icon", page 36, Booklocker.com Inc, 2001. The story depicted a fierce, carnivorous alien, the coeurl, stalking the crew of an exploration spaceship. It was the cover story Panshin, Alexei (1994) “Introduction to Slan”, The Easton press,  Connecticut, USA. Available on-line http://vanvogt.www4.mmedia.is/intoslan.htm

Lester del Rey ({{cite book}}) comments that "July was the turning point". The story served as the inspiration for a number of science fiction movies.{{quote}}

{{quote}} In 1950 it was combined with "War of Nerves" (1950), "Discord in Scarlet" (1939) and "M33 in Andromeda" (1943) to form the novel The Voyage of the Space Beagle (1950).In 1941, van Vogt decided to become a full-time writer, quitting his job at the Canadian Department of National Defence. Extremely prolific for a few years, van Vogt wrote a large number of short stories. In the 1950s, many of them were retrospectively patched together into novels, or "fixups" as he called them, a term which entered the vocabulary of science fiction criticism. When the original stories were related (e.g. The War against the Rull) this was often successful. When not (e.g. Quest for the Future) the disparate stories thrown together generally made for a less coherent plot.One of van Vogt's best-known novels of this period is Slan, which was originally serialised in Astounding Science Fiction (September - December 1940). Using what became one of van Vogt's recurring themes, it told the story of a 9-year-old superman living in a world in which his kind are slain by Homo sapiens.
Post-war philosophy
In 1944, van Vogt moved to Hollywood, California, where his writing took on new dimensions after World War II. Van Vogt was always interested in the idea of all-encompassing systems of knowledge (akin to modern meta-systems) -- the characters in his very first story used a system called 'Nexialism' to analyze the alien's behaviour, and he became interested in the General Semantics of Alfred Korzybski.He subsequently wrote three novels merging these overarching themes, The World of Null-A and The Pawns of Null-A in the late 1940s, and Null-A Three in the early 1980s. Null-A, or non-Aristotelian logic, refers to the capacity for, and practice of, using intuitive, inductive reasoning (compare fuzzy logic), rather than reflexive, or conditioned, deductive reasoning.Van Vogt was also profoundly affected by revelations of totalitarian police states that emerged after World War II. He wrote a mainstream novel that was set in Communist China, The Violent Man (1962); he said that to research this book he had read 100 books about China. Into this book he incorporated his view of "the violent male type", which he described as a "man who had to be right", a man who "instantly attracts women" and who he said were the men who "run the world".At the same time, in his fiction, van Vogt was consistently sympathetic to absolute monarchy as a form of government.{{cite book}} This was the case, for instance, in the Weapon Shop series, the Mixed Men series and in single stories such as "Heir Apparent", whose protagonist was described as a "benevolent dictator".Van Vogt systematized his writing method, using scenes of 800 words or so where a new complication was added or something resolved. Several of his stories hinge upon temporal conundra, a favorite theme. He stated that he acquired many of his writing techniques from three books, "Narrative Technique" by Thomas Uzzell, and "The Only Two Ways to Write a Story" plus "Twenty Problems of the Short-Story Writer", both by John Gallishaw.Alexei Panshin, The Abyss of Wonder, Man Beyond Man, The Early Stories of A. E. van Vogt.He said many of his ideas came from dreams; throughout his writing life he arranged to be awakened every 90&nbsp;minutes during his sleep period so he could write down his dreams.Charles Platt, Who Writes SF? Savoy Books, 1980.In 1950, van Vogt was briefly appointed as head of L. Ron Hubbard's Dianetics operation in California.  Dianetics was the secular precursor to Hubbard's Church of Scientology.  The operation went broke 9 months later, but never went bankrupt, due to van Vogt's arrangements with creditors.  Van Vogt and his wife opened their own Dianetics centre, partly financed by his writings, until he "signed off" around 1961.  At the time of his interview with Charles Platt,  van Vogt was still president of the Californian Association of Dianetic Auditors.  Between 1950 and 1960, van Vogt produced collections, notable fixups such as: The Mixed Men (1952) and The War Against the Rull (1959), and the two "Clane" novels, Empire of the Atom (1957) and The Wizard of Linn (1962), which were inspired (like Asimov's Foundation series) by the fall of the Roman Empire, specifically Claudius. He resumed writing again in the 1960s, mainly at Frederik Pohl's invitation.  His later novels included fixups such as The Beast (aka Moonbeast) (1963), Rogue Ship (1965), Quest for the Future (1970) and Supermind (1977); expanded short stories (The Darkness on Diamondia (1972), Future Glitter (aka Tyranopolis) (1973); original novels such as Children of Tomorrow (1970), The Battle of Forever (1971) and The Anarchistic Colossus (1977); plus sequels to his classic works, many of which were promised, but only one of which appeared, Null-A Three (1984; originally published in French).  Several later books were original in Europe, and at least one novel has only ever appeared in Italian, no English version yet published.
On January 26, 2000, van Vogt died in Los Angeles, USA from Alzheimer's disease, and was survived by his second wife, the former Lydia Bereginsky.
Critical receptionCritical opinion about the quality of van Vogt's work has been sharply divided.An early and articulate critic was the noted author Damon Knight. In a chapter-long essay reprinted in In Search of Wonder, entitled "Cosmic Jerrybuilder: A. E. van Vogt", Knight famously remarked that van Vogt "is no giant; he is a pygmy who has learned to operate an overgrown typewriter." Knight described The World of Null-A as "one of the worst allegedly-adult science fiction stories ever published." About van Vogt's writing in general, Knight said:{{quote}}About Empire of the Atom Knight wrote:
{{quote}}Knight also expressed misgivings about van Vogt's politics, noting that his stories almost invariably present absolute monarchy in a favorable light.On the other hand, when science fiction author Philip K. Dick was asked Vertex, Vol. 1, no. 6, February 1974, available on-line http://www.philipkdick.com/media_vertex.html which science fiction writers had influenced his work the most, he replied:{{quote}}Dick also defended van Vogt against Damon Knight’s criticisms:{{quote}}In a review of Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt, science fiction writer Paul Di Filippo said:
{{quote}}In The John W. Campbell Letters, Campbell says, "The son-of-a-gun gets hold of you in the first paragraph, ties a knot around you, and keeps it tied in every paragraph thereafter{{mdash}}including the ultimate last one."{{cite book}}{{cite book}}Harlan Ellison (who began reading van Vogt as a teenager)Ellison, Harlan “Van is Here, But Van is Gone” Retrieved 2001-08-31 “Van is still with us, as I write this, in June of 1999, slightly less than fifty years since I first encountered van Vogt prose in a January 1950 issue of ‘’Startling Stories’’,…” wrote, "Van was the first writer to shine light on the restricted ways in which I had been taught to view the universe and the human condition."Writing in 1984 David Hartwell said:Hartwell, David (1984) “Age of Wonders: Exploring the Worlds of Science Fiction”, New York, Walker, Page 131-132. ISBN 978-0-89366-163-2{{quote}}The literary critic Leslie A. Fiedler said something similar:Fiedler, Leslie A. (1983) “The Criticism of Science Fiction”, Coordinates: Placing Science Fiction and Fantasy, ed. George E. Slusser, Eric S. Rabkin, and Robert Scholes (Carbondale Southern Illinoois University Press, page 10-11. ISBN 978-0-8093-1105-7{{quote}}The American literary critic Fredric Jameson says of van Vogt:{{quote}}Nevertheless, van Vogt still has his critics. For example Darrell Schweitzer writing to the New York Review of Science Fiction in 1999Schweitzer, Darrell (1999) “Letters of Comment”, New York Review of Science Fiction, May 1999, Number 129, Vol. 11, No. 9. quoted a passage from the original van Vogt novelette “The Mixed Men”, which he was then reading, and remarked:{{quote}}
RecognitionIn 1946, van Vogt and his first wife, Edna Mayne Hull, were co-Guests of Honor at the fourth World Science Fiction Convention.{{cite book}}In 1980, van Vogt received a "Casper Award" (precursor to the Canadian Aurora Awards) for Lifetime Achievement.{{cite web}} In 1995 he was awarded the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award by the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA). There was controversy over how late in van Vogt’s lifetime the SFWA left it to bestow their highest award. Writing an obituary of van Vogt a fellow Canadian writer of science fiction remarked:{{quote}}It is generally held that the “damnable SFWA politics” relates to Damon Knight, the founder of the SFWA, who abhorred van Vogt’s style and politics and thoroughly demolished his literary reputation in the 1950s.Hartwell, David: “The Way We Were: A. E. van Vogt, 1912-2000”, page 24, New York Review of Science Fiction, March 2000, Number 139, Vol. 12, No.7Harlan Ellison writing in 1999 the introduction to Futures Past: The Best Short Fiction of A.E. van Vogt was more explicit:{{quote}}In 1996, van Vogt was recognized on two occasions: the World Science Fiction Convention presented him with a Special Award for six decades of golden age science fiction, and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame included him among its initial four inductees.The works of van Vogt were translated into French by the surrealist Boris Vian (The World of Null-A as Le Monde des Å in 1958), and van Vogt’s works were “viewed as great literature of the surrealist school”.Watson, Ian (1999) “Science Fiction, Surrealism, and Shamanism”, page 9,

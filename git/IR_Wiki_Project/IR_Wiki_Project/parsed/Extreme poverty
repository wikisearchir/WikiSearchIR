Extreme poverty, as defined in 1996 by Joseph Wresinski, the founder of ATD Fourth World, is: "The lack of basic security connotes the absence of one or more factors enabling individuals and families to assume basic responsibilities and to enjoy fundamental rights. The situation may become widespread and result in more serious and permanent consequences. The lack of basic security leads to chronic poverty when it simultaneously affects several aspects of people’s lives, when it is prolonged and when it severely compromises people’s chances of regaining their rights and of reassuming their responsibilities in the foreseeable future."(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/13)
This definition was adopted by the UN Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in s:The Despouy Report on Human Rights and Extreme Poverty.In 2005 the World Bank defined extreme poverty as living on less than US$1.25 a day. This meant living on the equivalent of US$1.25 a day, in the US, buying US goods. In 2011, this means surviving on the equivalent to US$1.50, AUD$2 or 1 pound per day.{{cite web}} The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger was the first Millennium Development Goal, as set by 179 United Nations Member States in 2000. Economists and activists consider epidemic diseases (AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis) as crucial factors in and consequences of extreme poverty.{{Citation needed}}Extreme poverty is most common in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Campaigns around extreme poverty

Live Below the Line challenges people in developed countries to feed themselves with the equivalent of the extreme poverty line to raise awareness of the challenges faced by those trapped in the cycle of extreme poverty, and raise funds for organisations working against global poverty. This campaign was started by the Global Poverty Project and the Oaktree Foundation and was launched in 2010. 
40 Hour Famine - World Vision Australia started the 40 Hour Famine in 1975 to raise money to help children, their families and communities in desperate need. The funds raised each year by the 40 Hour Famine continue to support World Vision&#39;s work tackling the causes of poverty, through both short term solutions and long term development projects.

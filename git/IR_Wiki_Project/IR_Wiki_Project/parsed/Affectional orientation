{{Sexual orientation}}Affectional orientation (or romantic orientation) is used both alternatively and side-by-side with sexual orientation.Crethar, H. C. & Vargas, L. A. (2007). Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling. In J. Gregoire & C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p.61. It is based on the perspective that sexual attraction is but a single component of a larger dynamic. To holders of this view, one's (human?)orientation is defined by whom one is predisposed to fall in love with, whether or not one desires that person sexually. Lately(-since the year 0000), the predominant use of the term "sexual orientation" is considered to reduce a whole category of desires and emotions, as well as power and connection, to sex.This is an important concept amongst the asexual community where it is often referred to as romantic orientation and the term affectional orientation is rarely used. It does however retain its separation from sexual attraction and as such is seen by many as an orientation within an orientation amongst the asexual community. Taking from the fact that amongst this community this is known as the romantic orientation, the prefixes of homo-, hetero-, bi-, pan-, poly-, demi- and a- have been used to form terms such as heteroromantic, biromantic and so on.http://www.asexuality.org/en/index.php?showtopic=44350&st=60 It is a common term and part of every day conversation on the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) forums, and many members will refer to themselves as "[romantic orientation] asexuals".However, some asexuals who identify as straight, gay, lesbian, or bi before asexual, or simply prefer that terminology, will sometimes refer to themselves as "straight asexual" or "asexual lesbian". This simply means the same thing as a "heteroromantic asexual" or a "homoromantic asexual." One who lacks a romantic orientation, or is incapable of feeling romantic attraction, is known as aromantic. Aromantics can still have a sexual orientation (e.g., "bisexual aromantic" or "heterosexual aromantic"). A person who does not feel neither romantic or sexual attraction is known as an aromantic asexual.

{{nihongo}}, also known as {{nihongo}}, is an area of Tokyo, Japan. It is located less than five minutes by rail from Tokyo Station. Its name is frequently shortened to {{nihongo}} in Japan. While there is an official locality named Akibahara, which is also ??? in kanji, nearby (as part of Tait?-ku), the area known to most people as Akihabara (including the railway station of the same name) also include Soto-Kanda, a part of Chiyoda-ku.Akihabara is a major shopping area for electronic, computer, anime, and otaku goods, including new and used items. New items are mostly to be found on the main street, Ch??d?ri, with many kinds of used items found in the back streets of Soto Kanda 3-ch?me. New parts for PC-building are readily available from a variety of stores. Tools, electrical parts, wires, microsized cameras and similar items are found in the cramped passageways of Soto Kanda 1-ch?me (near the station). Foreign tourists tend to visit the big name shops like Laox or other speciality shops near the station, though there is more variety and lower prices at locales a little further away. Akihabara gained some fame through being home to one of the first stores devoted to personal robots and robotics.The area was just out of Sujikai-gomon city gate (present Mansei bridge) which was one of the city gates (Mitsuke) of old Edo (Tokyo). It was the gateway from inner Edo to northern and northwestern Japan and Kan’ei-ji temple in Ueno. Many dealers, craftsmen and relatively lower class samurai lived there.
Timeline


1869: A major blaze destroyed the area. It brought about the decision to clear the 30,000 square metres of land in order to keep future fires from getting into inner Tokyo city.
1870: In this cleared land a small Shinto shrine once in old Edo Castle was built. The shrine&#39;s name was {{lang}}, which means &#34;the extinguisher shrine&#34;). But many downtown Tokyo residents misunderstood the shrine. They thought that the deity Akiba or Akiha ({{lang}}) which was the most popular fire-controlling deity in central and eastern Japan must have been enshrined in it. They also called the cleared land &#34;Akiba ga hara&#34; or &#34;Akibappara&#34; which means &#34;the deity Akiba&#39;s square&#34;.
1888: The shrine moved to Matsugaya, near Asakusa.
1890: Extension of the rail line (now the T?hoku Main Line) from Ueno to Akihabara. At first there was no passenger service, for south of the station was the Akihabara cargo docks, where goods from all over the world would flow into Kanda by river and be hauled up the east bank of the canal to be ticketed at the central cargo transport window.
From the Meiji to the Sh?wa period, as the electric railway improved transport to Akihabara and the surrounds, and especially  due to the growth in dealerships, the district was designated as Seika Ichiba ({{lang}}: vegetables and fruits market).
1925: Akihabara-Tokyo station connection opened as the Tohoku line extended to Tokyo.
1930: The temporary Manseibashi Subway Station opens; it is closed in November 1931.
1935: Official establishment of Seika Ichiba. (Kanda Seika Ichiba).
1936: The site of Manseibashi Station was closed (later the Transportation Museum—now closed). Railway mania had reached its zenith. The area became the number one place for electrical supplies.
Circa 1945-1955 After World War II, a black market at Kanda developed around the first school of electrical manufacturing (now the Tokyo Denki University:{{lang}}). Clustered around the Sobu Main line, what began as a host of electrical stores selling vacuum tubes, radio goods and electrical items to the students, has today come to be known as Electric Town. Called &#34;musen&#34; or &#34;wireless&#34; shops, they were the first to begin selling radios. With the advent of wireless and radio goods, people came to be much more connected.
1960s: Thanks to advanced technology, the rival Nipponbashi district of Osaka took its position as an equally prominent Electric Town, selling vast volumes of household consumer durable goods such as televisions, refrigerators and washing machines.
1980s: Accompanying the spread of the personal computer in family homes (&#34;Famikon&#34;), local shops increasingly began to deal in video games, and major gaming chain stores appeared on the market.
1989: Kanda Seika Ichiba moved to ?ta-ku, south district of Tokyo.
1990s: With the Yamada and Kojima household chain stores appearing throughout the suburban outskirts of Tokyo, the sale of consumer durables at Akihabara was greatly reduced, but the sale of computer goods increased in equal measure.
1991:Sofmap begins its rise as a major seller of new and used Japan-market computer parts and software, including popular systems from NEC (PC-8801 and 9801), Sharp (X68000) and Fujitsu (FM-Towns). Sofmap chain stores begin popping up in different locations in Akihabara.
1994: The Windows PC boom and accompanying computer store growth began.
It was also during the 1990s that the anime craze grew out of video games, and the youth group known as otaku began to pour into Akihabara.
Since 2000, with name-brand computer sales in decline, anime shops have arisen in their place, selling to the otaku crowd.
August 25, 2005: Tsukuba Express, Tokyo&#39;s fastest private railway, opens in Akihabara.
Since 2005 Major redevelopment and modernization of the station and surrounding area.

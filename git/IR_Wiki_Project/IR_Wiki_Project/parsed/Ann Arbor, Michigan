title{{Other uses}}{{Featured article}}{{Infobox settlement}}Ann Arbor is a city in the U.S. state of Michigan and the county seat of Washtenaw County.  The 2010 census places the population at 113,934, making it the sixth largest city in Michigan.Population of Michigan Cities, Villages, Townships, and Remainders of Townships. www.michigan.gov. The Ann Arbor Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) had a population of 344,791 as of 2010. The city is also part of the larger Detroit – Ann Arbor – Flint, MI CSA.Ann Arbor was founded in 1824, with one theory stating that it is named after the spouses of the city's founders and for the stands of trees in the area.Marwil, pp. 1–2 The University of Michigan moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor in 1837, and the city showed steady growth throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, with a decline during the Depression of 1873. During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a focal-point for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the civil-rights movement and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as the student movement.Today, Ann Arbor is home to the University of Michigan, which is the dominant institution of higher learning in the city. The university shapes Ann Arbor's economy significantly as it employs about 30,000 workers, including about 12,000 in the medical center. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development money, and by its graduates.{{cite web}} Ann Arbor has increasingly found itself grappling with the effects of sharply rising land values and gentrification, as well as urban sprawl stretching far into the outlying countryside.{{cite web}}
History{{Main}}
Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by land speculators John Allen and Elisha Rumsey. On May&nbsp;25, 1824, the town plat was registered with Wayne County as "Annsarbour"; this represents the earliest known use of the town's name.Marwil, p. 1 There are various accounts concerning the origin of the settlement's name; one states that Allen and Rumsey decided to name it for their wives, both named Ann, and for the stands of burr oak in the {{convert}} of land they purchased for $800 from the federal government at $1.25 per acre. Regional Michigan Ojibwa named the settlement kaw-goosh-kaw-nick, after the sound of Allen's sawmill.{{cite book}}
Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County in 1827,Marwil, p. 4 and was incorporated as a village in 1833.Marwil, p. 7 The Ann Arbor Land Company, a group of speculators, set aside {{convert}} of undeveloped land and offered it to the state of Michigan as the site of the state capital, but lost the bid to Lansing. In 1837, the property was accepted instead as the site of the University of Michigan, which moved from Detroit.Marwil, p. 13Since the university's establishment in the city in 1837, the history of both the University of Michigan and Ann Arbor are closely linked.{{cite web}} The town became a regional transportation hub in 1839 with the arrival of the Michigan Central Railroad, and a north—south railway connecting Ann Arbor to Toledo and other markets to the south was established in 1878.Marwil, p. 49 Throughout 1840s and the 1850s settlers continued to come to Ann Arbor. While the earlier settlers were primarily of British ancestry, the newer settlers also consisted of Germans, Irish,Marwil, p. 16 and African-Americans.{{cite web}} In 1851, Ann Arbor was chartered as a city,{{cite book}} though the city showed a drop in population during the Depression of 1873. It was not until the early 1880s that Ann Arbor again saw robust growth,{{cite web}} with new immigrants coming from Greece, Italy, Russia, and Poland. Ann Arbor saw increased growth in manufacturing, particularly in milling.{{cite web}} Ann Arbor's Jewish community also grew after the turn of the 20th century, and its first and oldest synagogue, Beth Israel Congregation, was established in 1916.History, Beth Israel Congregation website, About Us. Retrieved February 16, 2008.
During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and served as a hub for the civil-rights movement and anti-Vietnam War movement, as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group Students for a Democratic Society took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. teach-in against the Vietnam War.Marwil, p. 153 During the ensuing 15 years, many countercultural and New Left enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city.{{cite web}} These influences washed into municipal politics during the early and mid-1970s when three members of the Human Rights Party (HRP) won city council seats on the strength of the student vote. During their time on the council, HRP representatives fought for measures including pioneering antidiscrimination ordinances, measures decriminalizing marijuana possession, and a rent-control ordinance;{{cite web}} many of these remain in effect in modified form. Alongside these liberal and left-wing efforts, a small group of conservative institutions were born in Ann Arbor. These include Word of God (established in 1967), a charismatic inter-denominational movement; and the Thomas More Law Center (established in 1999), a religious-conservative advocacy group.{{cite web}}Following a 1956 vote the city of East Ann Arbor merged with Ann Arbor to encompass the eastern sections of the city.{{cite web}}In the past several decades, Ann Arbor has grappled with the effects of sharply rising land values, gentrification, and urban sprawl stretching into outlying countryside. On November&nbsp;4, 2003, voters approved a greenbelt plan under which the city government bought development rights to pieces of land adjacent to Ann Arbor to preserve them from sprawling development. Since then, a vociferous local debate has hinged on how and whether to accommodate and guide development within city limits.{{cite journal}} Ann Arbor consistently ranks in the "top places to live" lists published by various mainstream media outlets every year. In 2008, it was ranked 27th out of 100 "America's best small cities."{{cite web}}

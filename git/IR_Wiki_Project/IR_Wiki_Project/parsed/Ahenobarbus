titleAhenobarbus was the name of a plebeian family of the Domitia gens in the late Republic and early Principate of ancient Rome.{{Citation}}  The name means "red-beard" (literally, "bronze-beard") in Latin. According to legend, Castor and Pollux announced to one of their ancestors the victory of the Romans over the Latins at the battle of Lake Regillus, and, to confirm the truth of what they had just said, they stroked his black hair and beard, which immediately became red.Suetonius, Nero 1Plutarch, Aemil. 25Dionysius of Halicarnassus, vi. 13Tertullian, Apol. 22The name may refer to:

title{{Infobox file format}}
The Au file format is a simple audio file format introduced by Sun Microsystems. The format was common on NeXT systems and on early Web pages. Originally it was headerless, being simply 8-bit µ-law-encoded data at an 8000&nbsp;Hz sample rate. Hardware from other vendors often used sample rates as high as 8192&nbsp;Hz, often integer factors of video clock signals. Newer files have a header that consists of six unsigned 32-bit words, an optional information chunk and then the data (in big endian format).Although the format now supports many audio encoding formats, it remains associated with the µ-law logarithmic encoding. This encoding was native to the SPARCstation 1 hardware, where SunOS exposed the encoding to application programs through the /dev/audio interface. This encoding and interface became a de facto standard for Unix sound.
New formatAll fields are stored in big-endian format, including the sample data.
{{-}}

32 bit word (unsigned) field Description/Content Hexadecimal numbers in C notation 
0 magic number the value 0x2e736e64 (four ASCII characters &#34;.snd&#34;) 
1  data offset the offset to the data in bytes. The minimum valid number is 24 (decimal), since this is the header length (six 32-bit words) with no space reserved for extra information. 
2  data size data size in bytes. If unknown, the value 0xffffffff should be used. 
3  encoding  Data encoding format:

1 = 8-bit G.711 µ-law
2 = 8-bit linear PCM
3 = 16-bit linear PCM
4 = 24-bit linear PCM
5 = 32-bit linear PCM
6 = 32-bit IEEE floating point
7 = 64-bit IEEE floating point
8 = Fragmented sample data
9 = DSP program
10 = 8-bit fixed point
11 = 16-bit fixed point
12 = 24-bit fixed point
13 = 32-bit fixed point
18 = 16-bit linear with emphasis
19 = 16-bit linear compressed
20 = 16-bit linear with emphasis and compression
21 = Music kit DSP commands
23 = 4-bit ISDN u-law compressed using the ITU-T G.721 ADPCM voice data encoding scheme
24 = ITU-T G.722 ADPCM
25 = ITU-T G.723 3-bit ADPCM
26 = ITU-T G.723 5-bit ADPCM
27 = 8-bit G.711 A-law
 
4  sample rate the number of samples/second, e.g., 8000 
5  channels the number of interleaved channels, e.g., 1 for mono, 2 for stereo; more channels possible, but may not be supported by all readers. 
The type of encoding depends on the value of the "encoding" field (word 3 of the header). Formats 2 through 7 are uncompressed PCM, therefore lossless.  Formats 23 through 26 are ADPCM, which is a lossy, roughly 4:1 compression.  Formats 1 and 27 are ?-law and A-law, respectively, both lossy.  Several of the others are DSP commands or data, designed to be processed by the NeXT MusicKit software.Note: PCM data appear to be encoded as signed, rather than unsigned.

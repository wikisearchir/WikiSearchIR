title{{Infobox Space mission}}Apollo 10 was the fourth manned mission in the American Apollo space program. It was an F type mission—its purpose was to be a "dry run" for the Apollo 11 mission, testing all of the procedures and components of a Moon landing without actually landing on the Moon itself. The mission included the second crew to orbit the Moon and an all-up test of the lunar module (LM) in lunar orbit. The LM came to within {{convert}} of the lunar surface during practice maneuvers.According to the 2002 Guinness World Records, Apollo 10 set the record for the highest speed attained by a manned vehicle at 39,897&nbsp;km/h (11.08&nbsp;km/s or 24,791&nbsp;mph) during the return from the Moon on May 26, 1969.Due to the use of their names as call signs, the Peanuts characters Charlie Brown and Snoopy became semi-official mascots for the mission.http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075138.jpghttp://science.ksc.nasa.gov/mirrors/images/images/pao/AS10/10075088.jpg  Peanuts creator Charles Schulz also drew some special mission-related artwork for NASA.

Crew notesApollo 10 was the first of only two Apollo  missions with an entirely flight-experienced crew. Stafford had flown on Gemini 6 and Gemini 9; Young had flown on Gemini 3 and Gemini 10, and Cernan had flown with Stafford on Gemini 9. They were also the only Apollo crew all of whose members went on to fly subsequent missions aboard Apollo spacecraft: Stafford later commanded the US vehicle on the Apollo Soyuz Test Project; Young commanded Apollo 16, and Cernan commanded Apollo 17.The Apollo 10 crew holds the distinction of being the humans who have traveled to the furthest point away from home, some {{convert}} from their homes and families in Houston.{{cite web}} While most Apollo missions orbited the moon at the same {{convert}} from the lunar surface, timing makes this distinction possible as the distance between the Earth and Moon varies by approximately {{convert}} (between perigee and apogee) throughout the year, and the Earth's rotation make the distance to Houston vary by another {{convert}} each day.  The Apollo 10 crew reached the furthest point in their orbit around the far side of the Moon at approximately the same time Earth had rotated around putting Houston nearly a full Earth diameter away.  The Apollo 13 crew holds the distinction of being the furthest any human has traveled from the Earth's surface.{{cite book}}By the normal rotation in place during Apollo, the backup crew would have been scheduled to fly on Apollo 13. However, Alan Shepard was given the command slot instead. Cooper was enraged and resigned from NASA. Later, Shepard's crew was forced to switch places with Jim Lovell's tentative Apollo 14 crew.Chaikin, pp. 347-48Deke Slayton wrote in his memoirs that Cooper and Eisele were never intended to rotate to another mission as both were out of favor with NASA management for various reasons (Cooper for his lax attitude towards training and Eisele for incidents aboard Apollo 7 and an extra-marital affair) and were assigned to the backup crew simply because of a lack of qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made. Cooper, Slayton noted, had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment, which he didn't. Eisele, despite his issues with management, was always intended for future assignment to the Apollo Applications Program (which was eventually cut down to only the Skylab component) and not a lunar mission.Donald K. Slayton, "Deke!" (New York: Forge, 1994), 236

LM closest approach to lunar surface

May 22, 1969, 21:29:43 UTC

On May 22, 1969 at 20:35:02 UTC, a 27.4 second LM descent propulsion system burn inserted the LM into a descent orbit of {{convert}} by {{convert}} so that the resulting lowest point in the orbit occurred about 15° from lunar landing site 2 (the Apollo 11 landing site). The lowest measured point in the trajectory was {{convert}} above the lunar surface at 21:29:43 UTC.{{cite book}}
Mission highlightsThis dress rehearsal for a Moon landing brought Stafford and Cernan's lunar module Snoopy to {{convert}} from the lunar surface. The low approach orbit was to refine the lunar gravitational potential needed to calibrate the powered descent guidance system{{Cite document}} to within {{convert}} (LR altitude update lock) needed for a landing.  Earth-based observations, unmanned spacecraft, and Apollo 8 respectively had allowed calibration to {{convert}}, {{convert}}, and {{convert}}.  Except for that final stretch, the mission went exactly as a landing would have gone, both in space and on the ground, putting Apollo's extensive tracking and control network through a dry run.Shortly after leaving low Earth orbit, the command/service module separated from the S-IVB stage, turned around, and docked its nose to the top of the lunar module still nestled in the S-IVB.  The CSM/LM stack then separated from the S-IVB for the trip to the Moon.Apollo 10 carried the first color television camera inside the spacecraft, and made the first live color TV broadcasts from space.Upon reaching lunar orbit, Young remained alone in the command module Charlie Brown while Stafford and Cernan flew separately in the LM. The LM crew checked out their craft's radar and ascent engine, rode out a momentary gyration in the lunar lander's motion (due to a faulty switch setting), and surveyed the Apollo 11 landing site in the Sea of Tranquility. The lunar module on this flight was not equipped to land, however. "A lot of people thought about the kind of people we were: 'Don't give those guys an opportunity to land, 'cause they might!'" said Cernan. "So the ascent module, the part we lifted off the lunar surface with, was short-fueled. The fuel tanks weren't full. So had we literally tried to land on the Moon, we couldn't have gotten off."{{Citation needed}} The fueled Apollo 10 LM weighed {{convert}}, compared to {{convert}} for the Apollo 11 LM which made the first landing.{{Citation}}Splashdown occurred in the Pacific Ocean on May 26, 1969 at 16:52:23 UTC, approximately {{convert}} east of American Samoa. The astronauts were recovered by the USS Princeton, and subsequently flown to Pago Pago International Airport in Tafuna for a greeting reception, before being flown on a C-141 cargo plane to Honolulu.
Hardware dispositionThe LM Snoopy's descent stage was left in orbit, but eventually crashed onto the lunar surface because of the Moon's non-uniform gravitational field; its location was not tracked.After being jettisoned, Snoopy's ascent stage flew on a trajectory past the Moon into a heliocentric orbit,http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/missions/apollo10.html making it the sole intact Lunar Module ascent stage remaining of the 10 LMs sent into space. The remaining ascent stages were either left in orbit to eventually crash like Snoopy, intentionally crashed onto the Moon to obtain readings from seismometers placed on the lunar surface, or else burned up in Earth's atmosphere.The Command Module Charlie Brown is currently on loan to the Science Museum in London, where it is on display. Charlie Brown's Service Module was jettisoned just before re-entry and burned up in Earth's atmosphere.
Mission insigniaThe shield-shaped emblem for the flight shows a large, three-dimensional Roman numeral X sitting on the moon's surface, in Stafford's words, "to show that we had left our mark." Although it did not land on the moon, the prominence of the number represents the significant contributions the mission made to the Apollo program.  A CSM circles the moon as an LM ascent stage flies up from its low pass over the lunar surface with its engine firing. The earth is visible in the background. A wide, light blue border carries the word APOLLO at the top and the crew names around the bottom. The patch is trimmed in gold. The insignia was designed by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International.{{cite web}}

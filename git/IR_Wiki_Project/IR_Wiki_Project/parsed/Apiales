title{{Automatic taxobox}}The Apiales are an order of flowering plants. The families given at right are those recognized in the APG III system. This is typical of the newer classifications, though there is some slight variation, and in particular the Torriceliaceae may be divided. Gregory M. Plunkett, Gregory T. Chandler, Porter P. Lowry, Steven M. Pinney, and Taylor S. Sprenkle. 2004. "Recent advances in understanding Apiales and a revised classification". South African Journal of Botany 70(3):371-381.Under this definition well-known members include carrots, celery, parsley, and ivy.The order Apiales is placed within the asterid group of eudicots as circumscribed by the APG III system. Within the asterids, Apiales belongs to an unranked group called the campanulids,Richard C. Winkworth, Johannes Lundberg, and Michael J. Donoghue. 2008. "Toward a resolution of Campanulid phylogeny, with special reference to the placement of Dipsacales". Taxon 57(1):53-65. and within the campanulids, it belongs to a clade that is known in phylogenetic nomenclature as Apiidae.{{citation}} In 2010, a subclade of Apiidae was named Dipsapiidae and was defined to consist of the three orders Apiales Paracryphiales, and Dipsacales.{{cite doi}}The circumscriptions of some of the families have changed. In 2009, it was shown that one of the subfamilies of Araliaceae was polyphyletic. {{cite doi}}
HistoryThe present understanding of the Apiales is fairly recent and is based upon comparison of DNA sequences by phylogenetic methods.{{cite doi}}Under the Cronquist system, only the Apiaceae and Araliaceae were included here, and the restricted order was placed among the rosids rather than the asterids. The Pittosporaceae were placed within the Rosales, and many of the other forms within the family Cornaceae. Pennantia was in the family Icacinaceae.

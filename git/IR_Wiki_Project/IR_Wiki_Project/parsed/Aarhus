{{Infobox settlement}}Aarhus or Århus ({{IPA-da}}) is the second-largest city in Denmark. The principal port of Denmark, Aarhus is on the east side of the peninsula of Jutland in the geographical center of Denmark. Aarhus is the seat of the council of Aarhus municipality with 311,235http://www.dst.dk/Statistik/kit.aspx inhabitants and 249,709 (1 January 2011) in the inner urban area.
According to Aarhus municipality, the "Greater Aarhus" area has a population of about 1.2 million people.http://www.aarhus.dk/da/omkommunen/english.aspxhttp://www.aarhus.dk/~/media/Subsites/Aarhus-Wind-Energy/Dokumenter/Working-and-living.ashxhttp://www.businessaarhus.dk/~/media/Subsites/Business-Aarhus/Powerpoint-praesentationer/Aarhus-som-vkstby-english-new.ashx  The city claims the unofficial title "Capital of Jutland".Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich.

Name
The city was mentioned for the first time by Adam of Bremen who stated that "Reginbrand, bishop of the church of Aarhus (Harusa)" participated in a church meeting in the city of Ingelheim in Germany.Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae 2.4.During the Middle Ages the city was called Arus, and in Icelandic chronicles, it was known as Áróss. It is a compound of the two words ?r, genitive of ? ("river", Modern Danish å) and ?ss ("mouth", Modern Danish munding; in Modern Icelandic this word is still used for "river delta").{{Citation needed}} The name originates from the city's location around the mouth of the stream Aarhus Å (English: Aarhus RiverVisitAarhus (2011). The Aarhus River),VisitAarhus (2011). History of the city Å being the Danish word for a small river.Wiktionary (2011). å: NounThrough regular sound development, Medieval Danish Arus became Aars or Oes, a form which persisted in the dialects of the surrounding parishes until the 20th century. In 1406, Aarhus became prevalent in the written sources, and gradually became the norm in the 17th century. Aarhus is probably a remodelling after the numerous Low German place names in -husen, possibly as a result of the influence of German merchants.{{Citation needed}}
Aarhus/Århus spellingAfter the Danish spelling reform of 1948 Aarhus changed name to Århus.In 2010, a majority of the city council voted for a name change from Århus back to Aarhus, and the renaming came into effect on January 1, 2011.jp.dk (2010). Århus skifter navnPolitiken.dk (2010) Århus skifter navnBørsen (2010) Århus skifter navn Mayor Nicolai Wammen argued that the Aa spelling would strengthen the city's international profile, help private enterprise and make it easier to access Aarhus on the internet.{{cite news}} The Aarhus spelling has, however, always had some use in non-Scandinavian languages. There is considerable opposition to the Aa spelling and according to a May 2011 poll 59.8 % of the city's inhabitants preferred the Å spelling.{{cite news}} {{da icon}}Although many citations of the name on signs and other physical media still read Århus, official informational websites have effectively altered occurrences of Århus to Aarhus. Furthermore, certain geographically affiliated names have been updated to reflect the name of the city. An example is the Aarhus River for which the Danish name has been altered from Århus Å to Aarhus Å. However, in Danish it is always correct to write geographical names with the letter Å, while local councils since 1984 have been allowed to use the Aa spelling as an alternative option. When a local authority decides so, most newspapers and state institutions will re-adopt the pre-1948 Aa spelling and the Å spelling will in practice become second-place. However, the official authorities are the Danish Placename Commission{{cite web}} and the Danish Language Committee, publisher of the Danish Orthographic Dictionary, which will keep Århus as the main name and have Aarhus as a new, second option, in brackets.{{cite web}} {{da icon}}
History
The bishopric of Aarhus dates back to at least 951, and archaeological findings date back some 1,300 years to Viking times. The city itself is presumably older than 770 AD, making Aarhus the oldest big city in Scandinavia. The favorable central position of the city within Denmark afforded it trade from Germany, the Baltic countries, the greater peninsula of Jutland and the communities on the many smaller islands in its vicinity, which meant that trade always had a great significance to the town – a significance which is still true today.

The city did not expand outwards until the late 19th century, and Aalborg remained the largest city on the peninsula until the 1920s. The relatively fast, albeit late, growth of the city can be ascribed to the general tendencies of a population moving from rural to urban areas during the industrial revolution. Industrialisation meant that proximity to trade routes became more important, giving the harbour city some advantages over other nearby cities as new industries came into existence.
Viking Age and before

The oldest archaeological findings in Aarhus are glass pearls, which date to the end of the 7th century. Half buried longhouses, used both as homes and workshops for the Vikings have also been found.Hans Skov, "Aros 700–1000", in: Vikingernes Aros Århus 2005, 15–39. In the houses and the adjoining archaeological layers, combs, jewelry and basic multi-purpose tools have been found that indicate the settlement is from approximately year 900. Digs in the spring of 2005 revealed a so-called city-ditch from the year 850 which might have marked the trade centre upon which the city is built.{{Citation needed}}The finding of six runestones in and around Aarhus indicates the city had some significance around year 1000 as only wealthy nobles traditionally used them.Gundhild Øeby Nissen, "Runesten", in: Vikingernes Aros Århus 2005, 46–51. The center of Aarhus was once a pagan burial site until Aarhus' first church, Holy Trinity Church, a timber structure, was built upon it during the reign of Frode, King of Jutland, around 900.Damm, Annette. Viking Aros (2005) ISBN 87-87334-63-1
17th–18th centuriesDuring the wars of the 17th century, it is probable that the city suffered in a significant way. Fortifications still exist south of the city as a reminder of the German imperial campaigns between 1627 and 1629. In 1644, Sweden taxed the city harshly and between 1657 and 1659, it was occupied by Swedish troops on several occasions. {{Citation needed}}In spite of these and other misfortunes, such as plague and city-wide fires, Aarhus was still quite a significant city in Denmark due to its favourable geographical position which was of significant importance for trading. Trade came mainly from the inland of Jutland but also from Norway, Lübeck, Amsterdam, England, France and Spain. In the middle of the 18th century the trade fleet consisted of approximately 100 ships.{{Citation needed}}
19th centuryIn the 19th century, the city gained more independence from the dominance of Copenhagen and Hamburg. While it had been the third largest city in Jutland during the early 19th century, its population surpassed Randers in 1840 and in 1850, Ålborg, thus becoming the largest city in Jutland and the second largest in Denmark.{{Citation needed}}The city's material prosperity continued to increase as the harbour expanded and the railway network grew. Culturally, it marketed itself as the "Capital of Jutland" and expanded many of its cultural institutions like the national library, universities, the Aarhus Theatre and hospitals.
GeographyThe city lies roughly at the geographical centre of Denmark on the peninsula of Jutland. Forests reach from the south into the city to within a kilometre (0.6&nbsp;mi) of the city centre, because the city has grown around the forest, and some forest areas are completely surrounded by the city, such as Riis Skov. The city is built mostly around the harbour, which is predominantly industrial, although a large recreational marina is situated south of it as an extension.
While some of the highest points in Denmark are close to the city, the general landscape is typically hilly, interspersed with forests and meadows; the city itself is very hilly north of the centre (by Danish standards, that is; see Highest hill, Denmark). The coastline consists mainly of sandy beaches, but stony areas are not uncommon. {{Citation needed}} The immediate coastal regions are not heavily populated due to a national policy of keeping residences inland rather than crowding the coast. {{Citation needed}}The city lies at the junction of railway lines from all parts of the country. To the south west (about {{convert}}, by rail) lies a picturesque region that contains the Gudenå. Several larger lakes extend West from the Skanderborg railway junction and rise to heights exceeding {{convert}} at Himmelbjerget. The railway traverses this district of moorland and woodland to Silkeborg.
Administrative divisionsAarhus is divided into several districts and suburbs with its own postal code (Postdistrikter).Districts (boroughs) inside the 2nd city beltway:

DemographicsMore than 300,000 people live within the city limits of Aarhus,Aarhus Kommunes Statistiske Årbog, 2005{{Dead link}} while an additional 500,000 live in the surrounding local area of the East Jutland region.
Aarhus is also a major part of the larger East Jutland metropolitan area with 1,200,000 inhabitants, which makes East Jutland the second most-populated area in Denmark, after the Copenhagen area.Danmarks Statistik 2006a {{da icon}}{{cite web}} {{da icon}}Of the population of Aarhus, 65,000 are under 18 years of age. Aarhus has been growing at a steady rate of about 1% per year since 1950, when the city had about 150,000 inhabitants. Aarhus University estimates an increase of around 20,000 more students in the next six years, with attendant concerns over a lack of housing. {{Citation needed}} In response, the city council has already initiated a large range of building projects to house some 100,000 new citizens before 2030 so the city population will rise to almost 400,000 inhabitants. {{Citation needed}}The population of Aarhus is both younger and better-educated than the national average. This is often attributed to the high concentration of educational institutions and facilities in the area.Nearly 12% of the population are immigrants, which is high for Denmark, but modest when compared to some other European cities. The largest immigrant groups (January 1, 2008) are Lebanese (4,644), Turks (4,089), Somalis (3,476), Iraqis (3,140), Vietnamese (2,382), and Iranians (2,199). {{Citation needed}} These groups live mainly in the western parts of Aarhus, where the Gellerup area is infamous for its high concentration of immigrants (88%, 2006). The vast majority of the immigrants in Gellerup are Arabs, Turks and Somalis. Other large immigrant groups in Aarhus include Germans (1,573), Poles (1,555), Norwegians (1,050), Afghans (958), and Britons (763).
Economy
The harbour is one of the largest industrial harbours in Northern Europe and the largest in Denmark {{Citation needed}}. The facilities are very modern and handle approximately 12 million tonnes of cargo (2006) and are therefore among the 100 biggest containerports in the world.XII.Godsomsætning, Århus Havn, 2000 {{da icon}} Much agricultural produce is exported, while coal and iron are among the chief imports. The harbour itself is maintained by Århus Stevedore Kompagni A/S originally based in Aarhus but currently operating several harbours around the world.The region is a major producer of agricultural products with many large farms in the outlying districts. Cattle, pork and grain are the main products with a sizable related refinement industry present. Computer and technology heavy industries are mainly focused in the urban areas with an abundance of small and medium sized IT and service companies dotting the city centre. {{Citation needed}}The Ceres Brewery, part of Royal Unibrew, was originally founded in Aarhus. Royal Unibrew announced the closure of Ceres in 2008.
Culture
Aarhus is a centre for education on the peninsula of Jutland. It draws students from a large area, especially from the western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. There are many cafes and restaurants as well as discothèques, cinemas, museums, amusement parks, and various other entertainment venues . Each year, the town hosts several festivals and concerts, including Aarhus International Jazz Festival and Aarhus Festuge the biggest festival in Scandinavia. The Vestereng park facility is also a site for large popular-music concerts.One major tourist attraction in Aarhus is The Old Town ({{lang-da}}), which is not actually an old part of the city itself, but a collection of historic Danish buildings gathered from all around the country. The city also hosts the Tivoli Friheden amusement park as well as the deer park situated in the large nearby public forest.

Architecturally impressive sights include the 13th century cathedral in the centre of the city; Århus Domkirke is the tallest cathedral in Denmark, as well as the second longest in Northern Europe, being only {{convert}} shorter than its counterpart in Trondheim. The Aarhus City Hall is a uniquely designed building drawn by renowned architect Arne Jacobsen, located in the city centre. The city hall is included in the national educational canon for culture as an example of important architectural work.There are many museums scattered around the city with ARoS being the newest and largest featuring daily exhibits of contemporary art. Other museums include Aarhus Kunstbygning also featuring mostly contemporary art, Frihedsmuseet focusing on the occupation and resistance movement during World War II and Kvindemuseet mainly showcasing feminist history and culture.Being a comparatively large Danish city, Aarhus has received a fair share of immigrants from various other cultures and is as such also home to one of the few ghettos in Denmark, Gellerup. The international cultures present in the community are an obvious and visible part of the city's daily life and contribute to many cultural flavours uncommon for the North, such as the Arabic themed Bazar West, a market with shopkeepers predominantly of foreign descent.The city has an active and visible gay and lesbian community which the city officially attempts to promote and nurture.Homo i Århus at Aarhus.dk {{da icon}} The Aarhus Festuge festival usually includes several exhibits, concerts or events specifically designed for these communities. There are several clubs, discos and cafes aimed at gays and lesbians: Danish D-lite (sports), G bar(disco) or Gaia Vandreklub (hiking club) are a few examples.It is common for tourist brochures and local politicians to refer to the town with the tongue-in-cheek slogan "The world's smallest big city"{{cite web}} reflecting the fact that the city has everything a city needs despite not being a metropolis like London. Another popular, and perhaps better known, phrase to describe the city is "City of Smiles" – a slogan first coined by the city council in the 1930s as an advertising slogan, and which subsequently is used widely in popular culture today.

Transport
Aarhus Airport, a local airport of Aarhus, is located {{convert}} north-east of Aarhus, in Tirstrup. The number of available destinations leaving from Aarhus Airport is rapidly increasing because of the rising international interest in the City, but residents also use the bigger Billund Airport, situated {{convert}} south-west of Aarhus. There have been plans for constructing a new, bigger airport for a long time, but so far, the plans have not been realized.Aarhus is served by commuter rail that connects the city itself with neighbouring towns. The main station in Aarhus is Århus Central Station, which is located in the city centre. Most city bus lines go through the inner city and pass through either Park Alle or Banegårdspladsen (lit. English: "Central Station Square") or both. County and Inter-city buses terminate at Aarhus Bus Terminal which is located 900 meters north-west of Banegårdspladsen, in front of the Radisson SAS Scandinavia hotel located at Margrethepladsen 1, 8000 Århus C).The Danish ferry company Mols-Linien connects Aarhus with Copenhagen (located on the isle of Zealand). The fastest ferries in the world (100&nbsp;km/h) operate up to 10 times daily from the port of Aarhus to the port cities of Sjællands Odde and Kalundborg on Zealand. The ferries take both vehicles and the Busline 888, which is the fastest link between the two Danish capitals.Aarhus also has a free bike sharing system, Århus Bycykler. The bicycles are available from 1 April to 30 October at 57 stands throughout the city and can be obtained by placing a DKK 20 coin in the release slot, just like caddies in a supermarket. The coin can be retrieved when the bike is returned."Århus Bycyckel". Retrieved 6 October 2010.

In popular cultureIn Denmark, an "Aarhus story" — similar to a Molbo story — is a kind of derogatory ethnic joke. Such stories about the citizens of Aarhus began in the early 20th century and the term continues to be used colloquially. For example, one popular Aarhus story goes as follows. "Have you heard about the Aarhus citizen who was leafing through a phonebook and remarked: 'Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen, Jensen... How many phones does this guy have?'"H.A. Yearhouse, "De første 59 Aarhus-historier", Chr. Erichsens Forlag 1973.

Amino acids ({{IPAc-en}}, {{IPAc-en}}, or {{IPAc-en}}) are molecules containing an amine group, a carboxylic acid group, and a side-chain that is specific to each amino acid. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. They are particularly important in biochemistry, where the term usually refers to alpha-amino acids.An alpha-amino acid has the generic formula  H2NCHRCOOH, where R is an organic substituent;Proline is an exception to this general formula. It lacks the NH2 group because of the cyclization of the side-chain and is known as an imino acid; it falls under the category of special structured amino acids. the amino group is attached to the carbon atom immediately adjacent to the carboxylate group (the ?–carbon). Other types of amino acid exist when the amino group is attached to a different carbon atom; for example, in gamma-amino acids (such as gamma-amino-butyric acid) the carbon atom to which the amino group attaches is separated from the carboxylate group by two other carbon atoms. The various alpha-amino acids differ in which side-chain (R-group) is attached to their alpha carbon, and can vary in size from just one hydrogen atom in glycine to a large heterocyclic group in tryptophan.Amino acids serve as the building blocks of proteins, which are linear chains of amino acids. Amino acids can be linked together in varying sequences to form a vast variety of proteins.{{Cite web}}  Twenty amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or standard amino acids. These 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code. Nine standard amino acids are called "essential" for humans because they cannot be created from other compounds by the human body, and so must be taken in as food.Amino acids are important in nutrition and are commonly used in nutrition supplements, fertilizers, food technology and industry. In industry, applications include the production of biodegradable plastics, drugs, and chiral catalysts.
HistoryThe first few amino acids were discovered in the early 19th century. In 1806, the French chemists Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin and Pierre Jean Robiquet isolated a compound in asparagus that proved to be asparagine, the first amino acid to be discovered.{{Cite journal}}{{Cite book}} Another amino acid that was discovered in the early 19th century was cystine, in 1810,{{Cite journal}} although its monomer, cysteine, was discovered much later, in 1884.{{Cite journal}} Glycine and leucine were also discovered around this time, in 1820.{{Cite journal}} Usage of the term amino acid in the English language is from 1898.{{Cite web}}
General structure{{see}}

In the structure shown at the top of the page, R represents a side-chain specific to each amino acid. The carbon atom next to the carboxyl group is called the ?–carbon and amino acids with a side-chain bonded to this carbon are referred to as alpha amino acids. These are the most common form found in nature. In the alpha amino acids, the ?–carbon is a chiral carbon atom, with the exception of glycine.{{Cite book}} In amino acids that have a carbon chain attached to the ?–carbon (such as lysine, shown to the right) the carbons are labeled in order as ?, ?, ?, ?, and so on.{{Cite web}} In some amino acids, the amine group is attached to the ? or ?-carbon, and these are therefore referred to as beta or gamma amino acids.Amino acids are usually classified by the properties of their side-chain into four groups. The side-chain can make an amino acid a weak acid or a weak base, and a hydrophile if the side-chain is polar or a hydrophobe if it is nonpolar. The chemical structures of the 22 standard amino acids, along with their chemical properties, are described more fully in the article on these proteinogenic amino acids.The phrase "branched-chain amino acids" or BCAA refers to the amino acids having aliphatic side-chains that are non-linear; these are leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Proline is the only proteinogenic amino acid whose side-group links to the ?-amino group and, thus, is also the only proteinogenic amino acid containing a secondary amine at this position. In chemical terms, proline is, therefore, an imino acid, since it lacks a primary amino group,{{Cite journal}} although it is still classed as an amino acid in the current biochemical nomenclature,{{Cite book}} and may also be called an "N-alkylated alpha-amino acid".{{Cite book}}
IsomerismOf the standard ?-amino acids, all but glycine can exist in either of two optical isomers, called L or D amino acids, which are mirror images of each other (see also Chirality). While L-amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome, D-amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum, as in exotic sea-dwelling organisms such as cone snails.{{Cite journal}}  They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria,{{Cite journal}} and D-serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain.{{Cite journal}} The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself, but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can, in theory, be synthesized (D-glyceraldehyde is dextrorotary; L-glyceraldehyde is levorotary).
In alternative fashion, the (S) and (R) designators are used to indicate the absolute stereochemistry. Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are (S) at the ? carbon, with cysteine being (R) and glycine non-chiral.{{Cite web}} Cysteine is unusual since it has a sulfur atom at the second position in its side-chain, which has a larger atomic mass than the groups attached to the first carbon, which is attached to the ?-carbon in the other standard amino acids, thus the (R) instead of (S).
ZwitterionsThe  amine and carboxylic acid functional groups found in amino acids allow them to have amphiprotic properties. Carboxylic acid groups (-CO2H) can be deprotonated to become negative carboxylates (-CO2- ), and ?-amino groups (NH2-) can be protonated to become positive ?-ammonium groups (+NH3-). At pH values greater than the pKa of the carboxylic acid group (mean for the 20 common amino acids is about 2.2, see the table of amino acid structures above), the negative carboxylate ion predominates. At pH values lower than the pKa of the ?-ammonium group (mean for the 20 common ?-amino acids is about 9.4), the nitrogen is predominantly protonated as a positively charged ?-ammonium group. Thus, at pH between 2.2 and 9.4, the predominant form adopted by ?-amino acids contains a negative carboxylate and a positive ?-ammonium group, as shown in structure (2) on the right, so has net zero charge. This molecular state is known as a zwitterion, from the German Zwitter meaning hermaphrodite or hybrid.{{Cite book}} Below pH 2.2, the predominant form will have a neutral carboxylic acid group and a positive ?-ammonium ion (net charge +1), and above pH 9.4, a negative carboxylate and neutral ?-amino group (net charge -1). The fully neutral form (structure (1) on the right) is a very minor species in aqueous solution throughout the pH range (less than 1 part in 107). Amino acids also exist as zwitterions in the solid phase, and crystallize with salt-like properties unlike typical organic acids or amines.
Isoelectric point
At pH values between the two pKa values, the zwitterion predominates, but coexists in dynamic equilibrium with small amounts of net negative and net positive ions. At the exact midpoint between the two pKa values, the trace amount of net negative and trace of net positive ions exactly balance, so that average net charge of all forms present is zero.{{Cite book}} This pH is known as the isoelectric point pI, so pI = ½(pKa1 + pKa2). The individual amino acids all have slightly different pKa values, so have different isoelectric points. For amino acids with charged side-chains, the pKa of the side-chain is involved. Thus for Asp, Glu with negative side-chains, pI = ½(pKa1 + pKaR), where pKaR is the side-chain pKa. Cysteine also has potentially negative side-chain with pKaR = 8.14, so pI should be calculated as for Asp and Glu, even though the side-chain is not significantly charged at neutral pH. For His, Lys, and Arg with positive side-chains, pI = ½(pKaR + pKa2). Amino acids have zero mobility in electrophoresis at their isoelectric point, although this behaviour is more usually exploited for peptides and proteins than single amino acids. Zwitterions have minimum solubility at their isolectric point and some amino acids (in particular, with non-polar side-chains) can be isolated by precipitation from water by adjusting the pH to the required isoelectric point.
Occurrence and functions in biochemistry
Standard amino acids{{See also}}Amino acids are the structural units that make up proteins. They join together to form short polymer chains called peptides or longer chains called either polypeptides or proteins. These polymers are linear and unbranched, with each amino acid within the chain attached to two neighboring amino acids. The process of making proteins is called translation and involves the step-by-step addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain by a ribozyme that is called a ribosome.{{Cite journal}} The order in which the amino acids are added is read through the genetic code from an mRNA template, which is a RNA copy of one of the organism's genes.Twenty-two amino acids are naturally incorporated into polypeptides and are called proteinogenic or natural amino acids.  Of these, 20 are encoded by the universal genetic code.  The remaining 2, selenocysteine and pyrrolysine, are incorporated into proteins by unique synthetic mechanisms.  Selenocysteine is incorporated when the mRNA being translated includes a SECIS element, which causes the UGA codon to encode selenocysteine instead of a stop codon.{{Cite journal}} Pyrrolysine is used by some methanogenic archaea in enzymes that they use to produce methane.  It is coded for with the codon UAG, which is normally a stop codon in other organisms.{{Cite journal}} This UAG codon is followed by a PYLIS downstream sequence.{{cite journal}}

Non-standard amino acidsAside from the 22 standard amino acids, there are many other amino acids that are called non-proteinogenic or non-standard. Those either are not found in proteins (for example carnitine, GABA), or are not produced directly and in isolation by standard cellular machinery (for example, hydroxyproline and selenomethionine).Non-standard amino acids that are found in proteins are formed by post-translational modification, which is modification after translation during protein synthesis.  These modifications are often essential for the function or regulation of a protein; for example, the carboxylation of glutamate allows for better binding of calcium cations,{{Cite journal}} and the hydroxylation of proline is critical for maintaining connective tissues.{{Cite journal}} Another example is the formation of hypusine in the translation initiation factor EIF5A, through modification of a lysine residue.{{Cite journal}} Such modifications can also determine the localization of the protein, e.g., the addition of long hydrophobic groups can cause a protein to bind to a phospholipid membrane.{{Cite journal}}Some nonstandard amino acids are not found in proteins. Examples include lanthionine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, dehydroalanine, and the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Nonstandard amino acids often occur as intermediates in the metabolic pathways for standard amino acids — for example, ornithine and citrulline occur in the urea cycle, part of amino acid catabolism (see below).{{Cite journal}} A rare exception to the dominance of ?-amino acids in biology is the ?-amino acid beta alanine (3-aminopropanoic acid), which is used in plants and microorganisms in the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), a component of coenzyme A.{{Cite journal}}
In human nutrition{{further}}When taken up into the human body from the diet, the 22 standard amino acids either are used to synthesize proteins and other biomolecules or are oxidized to urea and carbon dioxide as a source of energy.{{Cite journal}} The oxidation pathway starts with the removal of the amino group by a transaminase, the amino group is then fed into the urea cycle. The other product of transamidation is a keto acid that enters the citric acid cycle.{{Cite journal}} Glucogenic amino acids can also be converted into glucose, through gluconeogenesis.{{Cite journal}}Pyrrolysine trait is restricted to several microbes, and only one organism has both Pyl and Sec. Of the 22 standard amino acids, 9 are called essential amino acids because the human body cannot synthesize them from other compounds at the level needed for normal growth, so they must be obtained from food.{{Cite journal}} In addition, cysteine, taurine, tyrosine, and arginine are semiessential amino-acids in children, because the metabolic pathways that synthesize these amino acids are not fully developed.{{Cite journal}}{{Cite journal}} The amounts required also depend on the age and health of the individual, so it is hard to make general statements about the dietary requirement for some amino acids.

Non-protein functions{{further}}In humans, non-protein amino acids also have important roles as metabolic intermediates, such as in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. Many amino acids are used to synthesize other molecules, for example:

Tryptophan is a precursor of the neurotransmitter serotonin.{{Cite journal}}
Tyrosine is a precursor of the neurotransmitter dopamine.
Glycine is a precursor of porphyrins such as heme.{{Cite journal}}
Arginine is a precursor of nitric oxide.{{Cite journal}}
Ornithine and S-adenosylmethionine are precursors of polyamines.{{Cite journal}}
Aspartate, glycine, and glutamine are precursors of nucleotides.{{Cite book}}
Phenylalanine is a precursor of various phenylpropanoids, which are important in plant metabolism.

However, not all of the functions of other abundant non-standard amino acids are known. For example, taurine is a major amino acid in muscle and brain tissues, but, although many functions have been proposed, its precise role in the body has not been determined.Some non-standard amino acids are used as defenses against herbivores in plants.{{Cite journal}} For example canavanine is an analogue of arginine that is found in many legumes,{{Cite journal}} and in particularly large amounts in Canavalia gladiata (sword bean).{{Cite journal}} This amino acid protects the plants from predators such as insects and can cause illness in people if some types of legumes are eaten without processing.{{Cite journal}} The non-protein amino acid mimosine is found in other species of legume, particularly Leucaena leucocephala.{{Cite journal}} This compound is an analogue of tyrosine and can poison animals that graze on these plants.
Uses in technologyAmino acids are used for a variety of applications in industry, but their main use is as additives to animal feed. This is necessary, since many of the bulk components of these feeds, such as soybeans, either have low levels or lack some of the essential amino acids: Lysine, methionine, threonine, and tryptophan are most important in the production of these feeds.{{Cite journal}} In this industry, amino acids are also used to chelate metal cations in order to improve the absorption of minerals from supplements, which may be required to improve the health or production of these animals.{{cite book}}  The food industry is also a major consumer of amino acids, in particular, glutamic acid, which is used as a flavor enhancer,{{Cite journal}} and Aspartame (aspartyl-phenylalanine-1-methyl ester) as a low-calorie artificial sweetener.{{Cite journal}} Similar technology to that used for animal nutrition is employed in the human nutrition industry to alleviate symptoms of mineral deficiencies, such as anemia, by improving mineral absorption and reducing negative side effects from inorganic mineral supplementation. {{cite web}}    The chelating ability of amino acids has been used in fertilizers for agriculture to facilitate the delivery of minerals to plants in order to correct mineral deficiencies, such as iron chlorosis.  These fertilizers are also used to prevent deficiencies from occurring and improving the overall health of the plants.{{cite book}} The remaining production of amino acids is used in the synthesis of drugs and cosmetics.

Expanded genetic code{{Main}}
Since 2001, 40 non-natural amino acids have been added into protein by creating a unique codon (recoding) and a corresponding transfer-RNA:aminoacyl – tRNA-synthetase pair to encode it with diverse physicochemical and biological properties in order to be used as a tool to exploring protein structure and function or to create novel or enhanced proteins.{{Cite journal}}{{Cite journal}}
Chemical building blocks{{further}}
Amino acids are important as low-cost feedstocks. These compounds are used in chiral pool synthesis as enantiomerically-pure building blocks.{{Cite journal}}Amino acids have been investigated as precursors chiral catalysts, e.g., for asymmetric hydrogenation reactions, although no commercial applications exist.{{Cite journal}}
Biodegradable plastics{{Further}}Amino acids are under development as components of a range of biodegradable polymers. These materials have applications as environmentally friendly packaging and in medicine in drug delivery and the construction of prosthetic implants. These polymers include polypeptides, polyamides, polyesters, polysulfides, and polyurethanes with amino acids either forming part of their main chains or bonded as side-chains. These modifications alter the physical properties and reactivities of the polymers.{{Cite journal}} An interesting example of such materials is polyaspartate, a water-soluble biodegradable polymer that may have applications in disposable diapers and agriculture.{{Cite journal}} Due to its solubility and ability to chelate metal ions, polyaspartate is also being used as a biodegradeable anti-scaling agent and a corrosion inhibitor.{{Cite book}}{{Cite journal}} In addition, the aromatic amino acid tyrosine is being developed as a possible replacement for toxic phenols such as bisphenol A in the manufacture of polycarbonates.{{Cite journal}}
ReactionsAs amino acids have both a primary amine group and a primary carboxyl group, these chemicals can undergo most of the reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, amide bond formation and imine formation for the amine group and esterification, amide bond formation and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group.{{Cite book}} The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.{{cite journal}} 
The multiple side-chains of amino acids can also undergo chemical reactions.{{Cite journal}} The types of these reactions are determined by the groups on these side-chains and are, therefore, different between the various types of amino acid.
Chemical synthesis{{Main}}
Several methods exist to synthesize amino acids. One of the oldest methods begins with the bromination at the ?-carbon of a carboxylic acid. Nucleophilic substitution with ammonia then converts the alkyl bromide to the amino acid.{{Cite book}} In alternative fashion, the Strecker amino acid synthesis involves the treatment of an aldehyde with potassium cyanide and ammonia, this produces an ?-amino nitrile as an intermediate. Hydrolysis of the nitrile in acid then yields a ?-amino acid.{{Cite journal}} Using ammonia or ammonium salts in this reaction gives unsubstituted amino acids, while substituting primary and secondary amines will yield substituted amino acids.{{Cite journal}} Likewise, using ketones, instead of aldehydes, gives ?,?-disubstituted amino acids.{{Cite journal}} The classical synthesis gives racemic mixtures of ?-amino acids as products, but several alternative procedures using asymmetric auxiliaries {{Cite journal}} or asymmetric catalysts {{Cite journal}}{{Cite journal}} have been developed.{{Cite journal}}At the current time, the most-adopted method is an automated synthesis on a solid support (e.g., polystyrene beads), using protecting groups (e.g., Fmoc and t-Boc) and activating groups (e.g., DCC and DIC).
Peptide bond formation{{Details}}
As both the amine and carboxylic acid groups of amino acids can react to form amide bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an amide linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins.  This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.{{Cite journal}} This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond.{{Cite journal}} As a result of this mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving towards their C-terminus.However, not all peptide bonds are formed in this way. In a few cases, peptides are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione is an essential part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids.{{Cite journal}} In the first step gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side-chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side-chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.{{Cite journal}}In chemistry, peptides are synthesized by a variety of reactions. One of the most-used in solid-phase peptide synthesis uses the aromatic oxime derivatives of amino acids as activated units. These are added in sequence onto the growing peptide chain, which is attached to a solid resin support.{{Cite journal}} The ability to easily synthesize vast numbers of different peptides by varying the types and order of amino acids (using combinatorial chemistry) has made peptide synthesis particularly important in creating libraries of peptides for use in drug discovery through high-throughput screening.{{Cite journal}}
BiosynthesisIn plants, nitrogen is first assimilated into organic compounds in the form of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and oxaloacetate to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate.{{Cite book}} Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too. Nonstandard amino acids are usually formed through modifications to standard amino acids. For example, homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway or by the demethylation of methionine via the intermediate metabolite S-adenosyl methionine,{{Cite journal}} while hydroxyproline is made by a posttranslational modification of proline.{{Cite journal}}Microorganisms and plants can synthesize many uncommon amino acids. For example, some microbes make 2-aminoisobutyric acid and lanthionine, which is a sulfide-bridged derivative of alanine.  Both of these amino acids are found in peptidic lantibiotics such as alamethicin.{{Cite journal}} While in plants, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is a small disubstituted cyclic amino acid that is a key intermediate in the production of the plant hormone ethylene.{{Cite journal}}
Catabolism
Degradation of an amino acid often involves deamination by moving its amino group to alpha-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate. This process involves transaminases, often the same as those used in amination during synthesis. In many vertebrates, the amino group is then removed through the urea cycle and is excreted in the form of urea. However, amino acid degradation can produce uric acid or ammonia instead. For example, serine dehydratase converts serine to pyruvate and ammonia.{{Cite book}} After removal of one or more amino groups, the remainder of the molecule can sometimes be used to synthesize new amino acids, or it can be used for energy by entering glycolysis or the citric acid cycle, as detailed in image at right.
Physicochemical properties of amino acidsThe 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties. Important factors are charge, hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity, size, and functional groups. These properties are important for protein structure and protein–protein interactions. The water-soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues (Leu, Ile, Val, Phe, and Trp) buried in the middle of the protein, whereas hydrophilic side-chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent. The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer. In the case part-way between these two extremes, some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane. In similar fashion, proteins that have to bind to positively-charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, while proteins binding to negatively-charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine. There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues.{{Cite journal}}Some amino acids have special properties such as cysteine, that can form covalent disulfide bonds to other cysteine residues, proline that forms a cycle to the polypeptide backbone, and glycine that is more flexible than other amino acids.Many proteins undergo a range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups are attached to the amino acids in proteins. Some  modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins,{{Cite journal}} or hydrophilic glycoproteins.{{Cite journal}} These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.{{Cite journal}}

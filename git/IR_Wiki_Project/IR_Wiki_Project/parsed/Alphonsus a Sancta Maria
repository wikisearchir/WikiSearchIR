Alphonsus a Sancta Maria, or Alphonso de Cartagena (1396 &ndash; July 12, 1456), Spanish historian, was born at Cartagena, and succeeded his father, Paulus, as bishop of Burgos. In 1431 he was deputed by John II, king of Castile, to attend the council of Basel, in which he made himself conspicuous by his learning.  He was the author of several works, the principal of which is entitled Rerum Hispanorum Romanorum imperatorum, summorum pontificum, nec non regum Francorum anacephaleosis. This is a history of Spain from the earliest times down to 1456, and was printed at Granada in 1545, and also in the Rerum Hispanicarum Scriptores aliquot, by R. Bel (Frankfort, 1579).

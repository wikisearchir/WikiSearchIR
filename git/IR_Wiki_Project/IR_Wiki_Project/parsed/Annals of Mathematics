The Annals of Mathematics (abbreviated Ann. MathAnn. Math is the ISO standard abbreviation and is used by Zentralblatt MATH, as shown at "Zentralblatt Serials and Journals", accessed August 9, 2011. or Ann. of MathThe abbreviation Ann. of Math is used by Mathematical Reviews, as shown at "Abbreviations and Names of Serials", American Mathematical Society, accessed August 9, 2011) is a bimonthly mathematical journal published by Princeton University and the Institute for Advanced Study. It ranks amongst the most prestigious mathematics journals in the world by criteria such as impact factor.
HistoryThe journal began as The Analyst in 1874Diana F. Liang, Mathematical journals: an annotated guide. Scarecrow Press, 1992, ISBN 0810825856; p. 15 and was established and edited by Joel E. Hendricks. It was "intended to afford a medium for the presentation and analysis of any and all questions of interest or importance in pure and applied Mathematics, embracing especially all new and interesting discoveries in theoretical and practical astronomy, mechanical philosophy, and engineering".{{cite journal}} It was published in Des Moines, Iowa, and was the earliest American mathematics journal to be published continuously for more than a year or two.{{cite journal}} Reprinted in Bulletin (New Series) of the American Mathematical Society 37 (1), 3&ndash;8, 1999. This incarnation of the journal ceased publication after its tenth year, in 1883, giving as an explanation Hendricks' declining health,{{cite journal}} but Hendricks made arrangements to have it taken over by new management,{{cite journal}} and it was continued from March 1884 as the Annals of Mathematics.{{cite journal}} The new incarnation of the journal was edited by Ormond Stone (University of Virginia). It moved to Harvard in 1899 before reaching its current home in Princeton in 1911.An important period for the journal was 1928–1958 with Solomon Lefschetz as editor.J. J. O'Connor and E. F. Robertson. Solomon Lefschetz. MacTutor History of Mathematics archive. Accessed February 2, 2010 During this time, the annals became an increasingly well-known and respected journal. Its rise, in turn, stimulated American mathematics.{{citation needed}} Norman Steenrod characterized Lefschetz' impact as editor as follows:"The importance to American mathematicians of a first-class journal is that it sets high standards for them to aim at. In this somewhat indirect manner, Lefschetz profoundly affected the development of mathematics in the United States."Princeton University continued to publish the annals on its own until 1933, when the Institute for Advanced Study took joint editorial control. Since 1998 it has been available in an electronic edition, alongside its regular print edition. The electronic edition was available without charge, as an open access journal, but since 2008 this is no longer the case. Editions before 2003 were transferred to the non-free JSTOR archive, and articles are not freely available until 5 years after publication.
EditorsThe current editors of the Annals of Mathematics are  Jean Bourgain (Institute for Advanced Study), David Gabai, Nick Katz, Peter Sarnak, Yakov Sinai, and Gang Tian (all from Princeton University).Editorial Board. Annals of Mathematics, Princeton University
ImpactAccording to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2009 impact factor of 4.174, ranking it first among 255 journals in the category "Mathematics".{{cite web}}

Ancient Greek astronomers visualized Aries as a ram lying down with its head turned to the right. The stars ?, ? and ? Arietis mark the ram’s head and horns, according to Ptolemy's Almagest.
HistoryIn the description of the Babylonian zodiac given in the clay tablets known as the MUL.APIN, the constellation now known as Aries was the final station along the ecliptic. It was known as {{lang}}, "The Agrarian Worker". The MUL.APIN is held to have been compiled in the 12th or 11th century BCE, but it reflects a tradition which takes the  Pleiades as marking vernal equinox, which was the case with some precision at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age (early 3rd millennium BCE).John H. Rogers, "Origins of the ancient contellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions", Journal of the British Astronomical Association 108 (1998) 9–28In later Babylonian tradition, the name of the constellation changes to {{lang}} "ram". The motive for the name change is unknown. John H. Rogers suggests that the "Agrarian Worker"  became the "Ram" via association with the legendary figure of Dumuzi the Shepherd. 
Gavin White suggests that the sumerogram  {{lang}} "man" may have come to be understood as Akkadian lu "sheep".Babylonian Star-lore by Gavin White, Solaria Pubs, page 128  Aries only rose to its prominent position as the leading sign of the zodiac in the Neo-Babylonian (7th century BCE) revision of the Babylonian zodiac, as Hamal (? Ari) came to be located close to the point of vernal equinox.In Hellenistic astrology, the constellation of Aries is associated with the golden ram of Greek mythology that rescued Phrixos, taking him to the land of Colchis. Phrixos sacrificed the ram to the gods and hung its skin in a temple, where it was known as the Golden Fleece."Astronomica", chapter 20, Hyginus, translation by Mary Grant

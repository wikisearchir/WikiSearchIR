Titus was a companion of Saint Paul, mentioned in several of the Pauline epistles. Titus was with Paul and Barnabas at Antioch and accompanied them to the Council of Jerusalem,{{Bibleverse}}; {{Bibleverse}} although his name occurs nowhere in the Acts of the Apostles.He appears to have been a Gentile – for Paul sternly refused to have him circumcised, because Paul believed Christ's gospel freed believers from the requirements of the 613 Mitzvot &mdash; and to have been chiefly engaged in ministering to Gentiles. At a later period, Paul's epistles place him with Paul and Timothy at Ephesus, whence he was sent by Paul to Corinth, Greece for the purpose of getting the contributions of the church there on behalf of the poor Christians at Jerusalem sent forward.{{Bibleverse}}; {{Bibleverse-nb}} He rejoined Paul when he was in Macedonia, and cheered him with the tidings he brought from Corinth.{{Bibleverse-nb}} After this his name is not mentioned until after Paul's first imprisonment, when he was engaged in the organization of the church in Crete, where Paul had left him for this purpose.{{Bibleverse}} The last notice of him is in {{Bibleverse}}, where he leaves Paul in Rome in order to travel to Dalmatia. The New Testament does not record his death.According to tradition, Paul ordained Titus bishop of Gortyn in Crete. He died in the year 107, aged about 95.It has been argued that the name "Titus" in 2 Corinthians and Galatians is nothing more than an informal name used by Timothy, implied already by the fact that even though both are said to be long-term close companions of Paul, they never appear in common scenes.Fellows, Richard G. "Was Titus Timothy?" Journal for the Study of the New Testament 81 (2001):33-58. The theory proposes that a number of passages—1 Cor. 4:17, 16.10; 2 Cor. 2:13, 7:6, 13-14, 12:18; and Acts 19.22—all refer to the same journey of a single individual, Titus-Timothy. 2 Timothy seems to dispute this, by claiming that Titus has gone to Dalmatia.cf 2 Timothy 4:10 The feast day of Titus was not included in the Tridentine Calendar. When added in 1854, it was assigned to 6 February.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 86 In 1969, the Roman Catholic Church assigned the feast to 26 January so as to celebrate the two disciples of Paul, Titus and Timothy, on the day after the feast of the Conversion of St. Paul.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 116 The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America celebrates these two, together with Silas, on the same date. The Orthodox Church commemorates him on 25 August and on 4 January.His relics, now consisting of only his skull, are venerated in the Church of St. Titus, Heraklion, Crete to which it was returned in 1966The Orthodox Messenger, v. 8(7/8), July/Aug 1997 after being removed to Venice during the Turkish occupation.

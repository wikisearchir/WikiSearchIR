title{{Infobox Space mission}}Apollo 16 was the tenth manned mission in the American Apollo space program, the fifth and penultimate to land on the Moon and the first to land in the lunar highlands. The second of the so-called J-missions, the mission was crewed by Commander John Young, Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly. Launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972, the mission lasted eleven days, one hour, and fifty-one minutes, and concluded at 2:45 PM EST on April 27.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}John Young and Charles Duke spent 71 hours&mdash;just under three days&mdash;on the lunar surface, during which they conducted three extra-vehicular activities, or moonwalks, totaling 20 hours and 14 minutes. The pair drove the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), the second ever produced and used on the Moon, a cumulative distance of {{convert}}. On the surface, Young and Duke collected {{convert}} of lunar samples for return to Earth, while Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly orbited in the Command/Service Module above to perform observations. Mattingly spent a total of 126 hours and 64 revolutions in lunar orbit. After Young and Duke rejoined Mattingly in lunar orbit, the crew released a sub-satellite from the Service Module. On the return trip to Earth, Mattingly performed a one-hour spacewalk to retrieve several film cassettes from the exterior of the Service Module.The decision to target the Apollo 16 lunar landing for the highlands region of the Moon was made to obtain samples of the Descartes Formation and the Cayley Formation. Geologists believed prior to the mission that both of these formations were volcanic in origin; however, samples returned from the lunar surface have since proven this hypothesis is incorrect. Three of the first four landings in the Apollo program landed in the lunar maria; the fourth was in the vicinity of Mare Imbrium. Accordingly, highest priority was given to a highlands site that would allow the astronauts to sample material older than the impact that formed the Imbrium basin.
Crew{{Spaceflight crew}}Ken Mattingly had originally been assigned to the prime crew of Apollo 13, but was exposed to the measles through Charles Duke, at that time on the back-up crew for Apollo 13, who had caught it from one of his children. He never contracted the illness, but was nevertheless removed from the crew and replaced by back-up Jack Swigert three days prior to the launch.{{cite news}} John Young, a captain in the United States Navy, had flown on three spaceflights prior to Apollo 16: Gemini 3, Gemini 10 and Apollo 10, which orbited the Moon.{{cite news}} One of nineteen astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966, Charles Duke had never flown in space before Apollo 16. He served on the support crew of Apollo 10 and was a capsule communicator for Apollo 11.{{cite web}}
Backup crew{{Spaceflight crew}}Although not officially announced, the original backup crew consisted of Fred Haise (CDR), William R. Pogue (CMP) and Gerald Carr (LMP) who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on Apollo 19.{{cite book}}{{cite web}} However, after the cancellations of Apollo 18 and Apollo 19 were finalized in September 1970 it meant that this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission as planned. Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled to serve as members of the backup crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were re-assigned to the Skylab program where they later flew on Skylab 4.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}

Mission insignia
The insignia of Apollo 16 is dominated by rendering of an American eagle and a red, white and blue shield, representing the people of the United States, overlaying a gray background, the lunar surface. Overlaying the shield is a gold NASA vector, orbiting the Moon. On the border of the insignia, there are sixteen stars, representing the mission number, and the names of the crew members: Young, Mattingly Duke. The blue border, containing the stars and names of the crew, is outlined in gold.{{cite web}} The insignia was designed from ideas originally submitted by the crew of the mission.{{cite web}}
Planning and training

Landing site selection
Apollo 16 was slated to be the second of the "J-missions," an Apollo mission type featuring the used of the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), increased scientific capability, and lunar surface stays of three days.{{cite web}} As Apollo 16 was the penultimate mission in the Apollo program and there was no new hardware or procedures to test on the lunar surface, the last two missions (the other being Apollo 17) presented opportunities for astronauts to clear up some uncertainties in understanding the Moon's properties. Although previous Apollo expeditions, including Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 obtained samples of pre-mare lunar material, before lava began to upwell from the Moon's interior and flood the low areas and basins, none had actually visited the lunar highlands.{{cite web}}Apollo 14 had visited and sampled a ridge of material that had been ejected by the impact that created the Imbrium impact basin. Likewise, Apollo 15 had also sampled material in the region of Imbrium, visiting the basin's edge. There remained the possibility, because both the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 landing sites were closely associated with the Imbrium basin, that different geologic processes were prevalent in areas of the lunar highlands far from Mare Imbrium. Several members of the scientific community remarked that the central lunar highlands resembled regions on Earth that were created by volcanic processes and hypothesized the same might be true on the Moon. They had hoped that scientific output from the Apollo 16 mission would confirm their suspicion.Two locations on the Moon were given primary consideration for exploration by the Apollo 16 expedition, the Descartes Highlands region west of Mare Nectaris and the crater Alphonsus. At Descartes, the Cayley and Descartes formations were the primary areas of interest in that scientists suspected, based on telescopic and orbital imagery, that the terrain found there was formed by magma more viscous than that which formed the lunar maria. The Cayley formation's age was approximated to be approximately that of Mare Imbrium based on the local frequency of impact craters. The considerable distance between the Descartes site and previous Apollo landing sites would be beneficial for the network of geophysical instruments, portions of which were deployed on each Apollo expedition beginning with Apollo 12.{{cite web}}At the Alphonsus, three scientific objectives were determined to be of primary interest and paramount importance: the possibility of old, pre-Imbrium impact material from within the crater's wall, the composition of the crater's interior and the possibility of past volcanic activity on the floor of the crater at several smaller "dark halo" craters. Geologists feared, however, that samples obtained from the crater might have been contaminated by the Imbrium impact, thus preventing Apollo 16 from obtaining samples of pre-Imbrium material. There also remained the distinct possibility that this objective had already been satisfied by the Apollo 14 and Apollo 15 missions, as the Apollo 14 samples had not yet been completely analyzed and samples from Apollo 15 had not yet been obtained.It was ultimately decided to target the Apollo 16 mission to the Descartes site. Following the decision, the Alphonsus site was considered the most likely candidate for Apollo 17, but was eventually rejected. With the assistance of orbital photography obtained on the Apollo 14 mission, the Descartes site was determined to be safe enough for a manned landing. The mission's specific landing site was located between two young impact craters, North and South Ray craters&mdash;{{convert}} and {{convert}} in diameter, respectively&mdash;which provided "natural drill holes" which penetrated through the lunar regolith at the site, thus leaving exposed bedrock that could be sampled by the crew.After selecting the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic units of the lunar highlands, were determined by mission planners to be the primary sampling interests of the mission. It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism; however, this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of retrieved lunar samples from the mission.
Training
In preparation for their mission, the Apollo 16 astronauts participated in an extensive training program that included, among other things, several field geology trips to introduce the astronauts to concepts and techniques they would eventually use on the lunar surface. During these trips, the astronauts would visit and provide scientific descriptions of geologic features they were likely to encounter on the surface of the Moon.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}{{cite web}} In July 1971, the Apollo 16 astronauts visited Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada for geology training exercises, the first time U.S. astronauts ever did so. Geologists chose the area because of a {{convert}} wide crater created approximately 1.6 million years ago by a large meteorite. During the training exercises the astronauts did not wear spacesuits, but carried radio equipment to converse with each other and a scientist-astronaut, practicing procedures they would use on the lunar surface.{{cite news}}In addition to field geology training, the astronauts also participated in training for the use of the spacesuits, adapting to the reduced lunar gravity, landing and recovery post-mission, sample collecting, maneuvering in the Lunar Roving Vehicle, survival training and preparation for other technical aspects of the mission.{{cite news}}
Mission highlights

Launch and outbound trip
The launch of Apollo 16 was delayed one month from March 17 to April 16. This was the first launch delay in the Apollo program due to a technical problem. During the delay, the spacesuits, a spacecraft separation mechanism and batteries in the Lunar Module (LM) were modified and tested.{{cite news}} There were concerns that the explosive mechanism designed to separate the docking ring from the Command Module would not create enough pressure to completely sever the ring. This, along with a dexterity issue in John Young's spacesuit and fluctuations in the capacity of the Lunar Module batteries, required investigation and trouble-shooting.{{cite news}} In January 1972, three months before the planned April launch date, a fuel tank in the Command Module was accidentally damaged during a routine test.{{cite news}} The rocket was returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building, the fuel tank replaced and the rocket returned to the launch pad in February in time for the scheduled launch.{{cite news}}The official mission countdown began  on Monday, April 10, 1972 at 8:30 AM, six days before the launch. At this point during the pre-mission preparations, the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 were participating in final training exercises in anticipation of a launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final preflight physical examination on April 11.{{cite news}} On April 15, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants were pumped into the spacecraft, while the astronauts rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.{{cite news}}The Apollo 16 mission successfully launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida at 12:54 PM EST on April 16, 1972.{{cite web}} The launch itself was nominal, with the crew experiencing vibration similar to that of previous crews. The first and second stages of the Saturn V rocket performed nominally; the spacecraft, along with the mission's three crew members aboard, successfully entered orbit around Earth just under twelve minutes after lift-off. After reaching orbit, the crew spent time adapting themselves to the zero-gravity environment and preparing the spacecraft for Trans Lunar Injection, the burn of the third stage rocket that would propel them to the Moon. In Earth orbit, the crew faced multiple minor technical issues, including a potential problem with the environmental control system and the S-IVB third stage's attitude control system, that were eventually resolved or compensated for in preparation for departure towards the Moon. After two orbits, the rocket's third stage reignited for just over five minutes, propelling the craft towards the Moon at approximately {{convert}}.{{cite web}} Six minutes after the successful burn of the S-IVB, the Command/Service Module, containing the crew, separated from the rocket and traveled for {{convert}} before turning around and retrieving the Lunar Module from inside the expended rocket stage. The maneuver, known as transposition, went smoothly and the LM was extracted from the S-IVB.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} Following transposition and docking, the crew noticed the exterior surface of the Lunar Module was giving off particles from a spot where the LM's skin appeared torn or shredded; at one point, Charlie Duke estimated they were seeing about five to ten particles per second. The crew entered the Lunar Module through the docking tunnel connecting it with the Command Module to inspect its systems, at which time they did not spot any major issues. Once on course towards the Moon, the crew put the spacecraft into a rotisserie "barbecue" mode in which the craft rotated along its long axis three times per hour to ensure even heat distribution about the spacecraft from the Sun. After further preparing the craft for the trans-lunar voyage, the crew began the first sleep period of the mission just under fifteen hours after launch.{{cite web}}By the time mission control issued the wake-up call to the crew for flight day two, the spacecraft was approximately {{convert}} away from the Earth, traveling at about {{convert}}. As the Apollo 16 spacecraft was not due to arrive in lunar orbit until flight day four,{{cite web}} flight days two and three were largely preparatory days, consisting of spacecraft maintenance and scientific research. On day two, the crew performed an electrophoresis experiment, also performed on Apollo 14, in which the astronauts attempted to prove the higher purity of particle migrations in the zero-gravity environment. The remainder of day two included a two-second mid-course correction burn performed by the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine to tweak the spacecraft's trajectory. Later in the day, the astronauts entered the Lunar Module for the second time in the mission to further inspect the landing craft's systems. The crew reported they had observed additional paint peeling from a portion of the LM's outer aluminum skin. Despite the apparent peeling on the LM's outer skin, the crew discovered that the spacecraft's systems were performing nominally. Following the LM inspection, the crew reviewed checklists and procedures for the following days in anticipation of their arrival and the Lunar Orbit Insertion burn. Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly reported a "gimbal lock" warning light, indicating the craft was not reporting an attitude. Mattingly alleviated this by realigning the guidance system using the Sun and Moon. At the end of day two, Apollo 16 was about {{convert}} away from Earth.{{cite web}}At the beginning of day three, the spacecraft was about {{convert}} away from the Earth. The velocity of the craft steadily decreased, as Apollo 16 had not yet reached the lunar sphere of gravitational influence. The early part of day three was largely housekeeping, spacecraft maintenance and exchanging status reports with mission control in Houston, Texas. The crew performed the Apollo light flash experiment, or ALFMED, to investigate "light flashes" that were seen by the astronauts when the spacecraft was dark, regardless of whether or not their eyes were open, on Apollo lunar flights. This was thought to be caused by the penetration of the eye by cosmic ray particles.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} During the second half of the day, John Young and Charlie Duke again entered the Lunar Module to power it up and check its systems, as well as perform housekeeping tasks in preparation for lunar landing. The systems were found to be functioning as expected. Following this, the crew donned their spacesuits and rehearsed procedures that would be used on landing day. Just before the end of flight day three at 59 hours, 19 minutes, 45 seconds after liftoff, while {{convert}} from the Earth and {{convert}} from the Moon, the spacecraft's velocity began increasing as it accelerated towards the Moon after entering the lunar sphere of influence.{{cite web}}After waking up on flight day four, the crew began preparations for the maneuver that would brake the spacecraft into orbit around the Moon, or lunar orbit insertion.{{cite web}} At a distance of {{convert}} from the Moon, the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay cover was jettisoned. At just over 74 hours into the mission, Apollo 16 spacecraft passed behind the Moon, losing direct contact with mission control. While over the far side of the Moon, the Command/Service Module's Service Propulsion System engine burned for six minutes and fifteen seconds, braking the spacecraft into an orbit around the Moon with a low point (pericynthion) of 58.3 and a high point (apocynthion) of 170.4 nautical miles (108.0 and 315.6 km, respectively).{{cite web}} After entering lunar orbit, Young, Duke and Mattingly began preparations for the Descent Orbit Insertion (DOI) maneuver to further modify the spacecraft's orbital trajectory. The maneuver was successful, decreasing the craft's pericynthion to {{convert}}. The remainder of flight day four was spent making observations and preparing for activation of the Lunar Module, undocking, and landing the next day.{{cite web}}
Lunar surface
Young, Mattingly and Duke continued preparing for Lunar Module activation and undocking shortly after waking up to begin flight day five. The boom that extended the mass spectrometer out from the Command/Service Module's Scientific Instruments Bay was stuck in a semi-deployed position. It was decided that Young and Duke would visually inspect the boom after undocking from the CSM in the LM. Young and Duke entered the LM for activation and checkout of the spacecraft's systems. Despite entering the LM forty minutes ahead of schedule, Young and Duke completed preparations only ten minutes early due to numerous delays in the process. With the preparations finished, Young and Duke undocked in the LM Orion from Mattingly in the Command/Service Module Casper 96 hours, 13 minutes, 13 seconds into the mission.{{cite web}} For the rest of the two spacecrafts' pass over the near side of the Moon, Mattingly prepared to shift Casper to a circular orbit while Young and Duke prepared Orion for the descent to the lunar surface. At this point, during tests of the CSM's steerable rocket engine in preparation for the burn to modify the craft's orbit, a malfunction occurred in the engine's backup system. According to mission rules, Orion would have then re-docked with Casper, in case mission control decided to abort the landing and use the Lunar Module's engines for the return trip to Earth. After several hours of analysis, however, mission controllers determined that the malfunction could be worked around and Young and Duke could proceed with the landing. As a result of this, powered descent to the lunar surface began about six hours behind schedule. Because of the delay, Young and Duke began their descent to the surface at an altitude higher than that of any previous mission, at {{convert}}. At an altitude of about {{convert}}, Young was able to view the landing site in its entirety. Throttle-down of the LM's landing engine occurred on time and the spacecraft tilted forward to its landing orientation at an altitude of {{convert}}. The Lunar Module Orion, with Young and Duke inside, landed {{convert}} north and {{convert}} west of the planned landing site at 104 hours, 29 minutes, and 35 seconds into the mission, at 2:23:35 UTC on April 21.{{cite web}}After landing, Young and Duke began powering down some of the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their spacesuits and took initial geological observations of the immediate landing site. Young and Duke then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule.  Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate breakfast and began preparations for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk, of the mission.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} After the pair donned and pressurized their spacesuits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, John Young climbed out onto the "porch" of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag, full of trash, to dispose of on the surface.{{cite web}} Young then lowered the equipment transfer bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human to walk on the Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image." Charles Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!" The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV), along with other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was completed without issue but, upon first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering wasn't working. He alerted mission control of the issue before setting up the television camera and planting the flag of the United States along with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP); while parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat flow experiment that had burned up with the Lunar Module Aquarius on Apollo 13 and had been attempted without success on Apollo 15, a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, Young and Duke collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, the pair mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a {{convert}} wide crater on the rim of Flag, a crater {{convert}} across. There, at a distance of {{convert}} from the LM, Young and Duke sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper regolith layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was here that Young retrieved, at the request of mission control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a breccia nicknamed Big Muley after mission geology principal investigator Bill Muehlberger.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about {{convert}} from the LM. Here, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a magnetic field experiment.{{cite web}} At this point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a 16mm movie camera.{{cite web}} After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, Young and Duke returned to the LM to closeout the moonwalk. They reentered the Lunar Module 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in mission control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.{{cite web}}{{cite web}}Shortly after waking up on the morning of flight day six three and a half minutes early, Young and Duke discussed with mission control in Houston the day's timeline of events.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} The second lunar excursion's primary objective was to visit Stone Mountain to climb up the slope of about 20 degrees to reach a cluster of five craters known as 'Cinco Craters'. After preparations for the day's moonwalk were completed, the astronauts climbed out of the Lunar Module. After departing the immediate landing site in the lunar rover, Young and Duke arrived at the day's first destination, the Cinco Craters, {{convert}} from the LM. At {{convert}} above the valley floor, the pair were at the highest elevation above the Lunar Module than any other Apollo mission. After marveling at the view from the side of Stone Mountain, which Duke described as "spectacular,"{{cite web}} the astronauts gathered samples in the vicinity. After spending 54 minutes on the slope, Young and Duke climbed aboard the lunar rover en route to the day's second stop, station five, a crater {{convert}} across. There, they hoped to find Descartes material that had not been contaminated by ejecta from South Ray Crater, a large crater south of the landing site. The samples they collected there, although their origin is still not certain, are, according to geologist Don Wilhelms, "a reasonable bet to be Descartes." The next stop, station six, was a {{convert}} wide blocky crater, where the astronauts believed they could sample the Cayley Formation as evidenced by the firmer soil found there. Bypassing station seven to save time, Young and Duke arrived at station eight on the lower flank of Stone Mountain, where they sampled material on a ray from South Ray Crater for about an hour. Here, they collected black and white breccias and smaller, crystalline rocks rich in plagioclase. At station nine, an area known as the "Vacant Lot",{{cite web}} which was believed to be free of ejecta from South Ray, Young and Duke spent about forty minutes gathering samples. Twenty-five minutes after departing station nine, the astronauts arrived at the final stop of the day, located halfway between the ALSEP site and the Lunar Module. Here, they dug a double core and conducted several penetrometer tests along a line stretching {{convert}} east of the ALSEP. At the request of Young and Duke, the moonwalk was extended by ten minutes. After returning to the LM to wrap up the second lunar excursion, the two astronauts climbed back inside the landing craft's cabin, sealing and pressurizing the interior after 7 hours, 23 minutes, and 26 seconds of EVA time, breaking a record that had been set on Apollo 15.{{cite web}} After eating a meal and proceeding with a debriefing on the day's activities with mission control, Young and Duke reconfigured the LM cabin and prepared for the sleep period.{{cite web}}Flight day seven was to be Young's and Duke's third and final day on the lunar surface, for they would return to orbit to rejoin Ken Mattingly in the Command/Service Module following the day's moonwalk. During the third and final lunar excursion of the mission, astronauts Young and Duke were to explore North Ray Crater, the largest of any of the craters any Apollo expedition had visited. After exiting Orion, the pair drove the lunar rover {{convert}} away from the LM before adjusting their heading to travel {{convert}} to North Ray Crater. The drive was smoother than that of the previous day, as the craters were more shallow and boulders were less abundant north of the immediate landing site. Boulders gradually became larger and more abundant as Young and Duke approached North Ray in the lunar rover. Upon arriving at the rim of North Ray Crater, they were {{convert}} away from the LM. After their arrival, the duo took photographs of the {{convert}} wide and {{convert}} deep crater. Young and Duke visited a large boulder, taller than a four-story building, which became known as 'House Rock'. Samples obtained from this boulder delivered the final blow to the pre-mission volcanic hypothesis, proving it incorrect. House Rock had numerous bullet hole-like marks where micrometeroids from space had impacted the rock. About 1 hour and 22 minutes after arriving, the astronauts departed for station thirteen, a large boulder field about {{convert}} from North Ray. On the way, they set a lunar speed record, travelling an estimated {{convert}} downhill. They arrived at a {{convert}} high boulder, which they called 'Shadow Rock'. Here, they sampled permanently shadowed soil. During this time, Mattingly was preparing the Command/Service Module in anticipation Young's and Duke's return approximately six hours later. After three hours and six minutes, Young and Duke returned to the LM where the completed several experiments and offloaded the rover. A short distance from the LM, Duke placed a photograph of his family and a United States Air Force commemorative medallion on the surface. Young drove the rover to a point about {{convert}} east of the Lunar Module, known as the 'VIP site', so its television camera, controlled remotely by mission control, could observe Apollo 16's liftoff from the Moon. Young and Duke then reentered the Lunar Module after a five hour and forty minute final excursion.{{cite web}} After pressurizing the LM cabin, the crew began preparing to return to lunar orbit.{{cite web}}
Return to Earth
Eight minutes before departing the lunar surface, capsule communicator (CAPCOM) James Irwin notified Young and Duke from mission control that they were go for liftoff. Two minutes before launch, they activated the "Master Arm" switch and then the "Abort Stage" button, after which they awaited ignition of Orion’s ascent stage engine. When the ascent stage ignited, small explosive charges severed the ascent stage from the descent stage and cables connecting the two were severed by a guillotine-like mechanism. Six minutes after liftoff, at a speed of about {{convert}}, Young and Duke reached lunar orbit.{{cite web}} Young and Duke, in the LM, successfully rendezvoused and re-docked with Ken Mattingly, who had remained in orbit to perform observations while his fellow crewmembers explored the surface, in the Command/Service Module. To minimize the transfer of lunar dust from the LM cabin into the CSM, Young and Duke cleaned the cabin before opening the hatch separating the two spacecraft. After opening the hatch and reuniting with Mattingly, the crew transferred the samples Young and Duke had collected on the surface into the CSM for transfer to Earth. After transfers were completed, the crew would sleep before jettisoning the empty lunar module ascent stage the next day, when it was to be crashed intentionally into the lunar surface.The next day, after final checks were completed, the expended LM ascent stage was jettisoned.{{cite web}} Because of a failure by the crew to activate a certain switch in the LM before sealing it off, it initially tumbled after separation and did not execute the rocket burn necessary for the craft's intentional de-orbit. The ascent stage eventually crashed into the lunar surface nearly a year after the mission. The crew's next task, after jettisoning the Lunar Module ascent stage, was to release a sub-satellite into lunar orbit from the CSM's Scientific Instrument Bay. The burn to alter the CSM’s orbit to that desired for the sub-satellite had been cancelled; as a result, the sub-satellite lasted half of its anticipated lifetime. Just under five hours later, on the CSM's 65th orbit around the Moon, its Service Propulsion System main engine was reignited to propel the craft on a trajectory that would return it to Earth. The SPS engine performed the burn flawlessly despite the malfunction that had delayed the lunar landing several days before.At a distance of about {{convert}} from Earth, Ken Mattingly, the Command Module Pilot, performed a "deep-space" extra-vehicular activity, or spacewalk, during which he retrieved several film cassettes from the CSM's SIM bay. While outside of the spacecraft, Mattingly set up a biological experiment, the Microbial Ecology Evaluation Device (MEED).{{cite web}} The MEED experiment was only performed on Apollo 16.{{cite web}} The crew carried out various housekeeping and maintenance tasks aboard the spacecraft and ate a meal before concluding the day.The penultimate day of the flight was largely spent performing experiments, aside from a twenty minute press conference during the second half of the day. During the press conference, the astronauts answered questions pertaining to several technical and non-technical aspects of the mission prepared and listed by priority at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston by journalists covering the flight. In addition to numerous housekeeping tasks, the astronauts prepared the spacecraft for its return to Earth, or atmospheric reentry the next day. At the end of the Apollo 16 crew's final full day in space, the spacecraft was approximately {{convert}} from Earth and closing at a rate of about {{convert}}.{{cite web}}{{cite web}} When the wake-up call was issued to the Apollo 16 crew for their final day in space by capsule communicator Tony England, the spacecraft was about {{convert}} out from Earth, traveling just over {{convert}}. Just over three hours before splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the crew performed a final course correction burn, changing their velocity by {{convert}}. Approximately ten minutes before reentry into Earth's atmosphere the cone-shaped Command Module capsule, containing the three crewmembers, separated from the expended Service Module, which would burn up during reentry. At 265 hours and 37 minutes into the mission, at a velocity of about {{convert}}, Apollo 16 began atmospheric reentry. At its maximum, the temperature of the spacecraft's heat shield was between {{convert}}. After successful parachute deployment and less than fourteen minutes after reentry began, the Command Module splashed down in the Pacific Ocean {{convert}} southeast of Christmas Island 290 hours, 37 minutes, 6 seconds after liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center. The spacecraft and its three-person crew were retrieved by the {{USS}}. Young, Duke and Mattingly were safely aboard the Ticonderoga recovery ship thirty-seven minutes after splashdown.{{cite web}}

On Monday, May 8, 1972, ground service equipment being used to empty the residual toxic reaction control system fuel in the command module tanks exploded in a Naval Air Station hangar. A total of 46 people were sent to the hospital for 24 to 48 hours observation, most suffering from inhalation of toxic fumes. Most seriously injured was a technician who suffered a fractured kneecap when the GSE cart overturned on him.

Schanze and a friend discovered a "stamp" on the {{convert}} flat metal sheet, which upon further inspection turned out to be a faded copy of the Apollo 16 mission insignia. NASA later confirmed the object to be a piece of the first stage of the Saturn V rocket that launched Apollo 16 into space. In July 2011, after returning the piece of debris at NASA's request, the sixteen-year-old Schanze was given an all-access tour of the Kennedy Space Center as well as VIP seating for the launch of STS-135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle program.{{cite news}}
